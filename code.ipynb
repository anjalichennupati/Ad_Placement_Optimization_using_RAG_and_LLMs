They integrated component of mass media used by Coca -Cola includes \\ntelevision advertising, banner ads, print advertising, direct marketing, w eb based interactive, \\nsales promotion, social media marketing and experience based marketing.  \\nIn 2011, Coca Cola completed 125 years. They wanted to celebrate their anniversary by doing \\nsomething different that was never tried before along with their coverage of traditional and digital mediums. Obscura Digital, a San Francisco -based technology lab and creative agency \\ndesigned and executed something which was really impressive!!!  \\nOn May 6, 2011, the Coca -Cola headquarters tower (a 26 -story tall building) in  Atlanta was \\nilluminated, showcasing a spectacular vision of the glorious 125 years and a “Thank You” \\nmessage for millions of customers who made it happen.  \\nCoca -Cola celebrated their anniversary in style.  \\nA few interesting facts about the massive campaign  for Coke’s 125th year are given below:  \\n1. The event projected the imagery from a library of 125 years of Coke’s advertising, \\nalong with the iconic Coke bottle featured in 3D across the 26 stories of the building.  \\n2. The projection covered an area of 157 feet i n width and 339 feet in height. The \\nprojection surface area from all 4 sides of the building was 210, 0000 sq. feet, making \\nit the world’s largest single building illumination.  \\n3. Obscura Digital created and executed the visual design and projections. They us ed 45 \\nprojectors (20,000 lumen each) approximately 1 million lumen of light were \\nsimultaneously projected on to the building.  \\n4. The event also showcased the pics uploaded by the Coca -Cola Facebook fans around \\nthe world.

       " Document(page_content=' \\n   \\n   \\n \\nFigure 2.1.1: Coca -Cola’s Campaign for completing 125 Years of Success  \\nThe above snippet highlights how Coca -Cola used an Integrated Marketing Communication \\nCampaign to say “Thank You” to their consumers for the magnificent 125 years of success.  \\nAdvertising is a complex form of communication. Businesses have found many different ways \\nto communicate their message to the consumer. Modern advertiser s have an array of choices \\nat their disposal. The Internet alone provides many options to the advertisers to reach out to their prospective customers. The most suitable advertising choice depends on the target audience and the most cost- effective way to reach them. For instance, if a company knows \\nthat the target market prefers to read a particular magazine or newspaper, then they should advertise in that publication.  \\nSuccessful advertising campaigns spread the information about a brand, attract prospectiv e \\ncustomers and generate sales. In this chapter, we will take a look on the different types of advertisements where a brand can be advertised.  \\n \\n2.1.2  Classification of Advertising on the Basis of \\nConsumers  \\n(i) Classified Advertising  \\nThis is a form of advertising where small messages are grouped under a specific heading or \\nclassification such as employment, real estate, automobiles and others. These are very common in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. Classified advertisemen ts are \\ncheaper in comparison to large display ads used by businesses. These ads are typically short, \\n \\n \\n45 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\ad_pdf.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

They do \\nnot include any graphics.  \\n \\nFigure 2.1.2: An Example of Class ified Advertising  \\n \\nFigure 2.1.3: Another Example of Classified Advertising  \\n(ii) Display Advertising  \\nDisplay advertising basically appears in websites. These advertisements can be in different formats and they have items such as text, images, flash, audio, vide os etc. The first banner \\ndisplay on the Internet was on October 27th, 1994. The basic objective of display ads is to deliver brand messages to the site visitors. eMarketer has estimated that Facebook and Twitter may account for 33% of display ad spending market share by 2017.  \\n \\n \\n \\n46 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\ad_pdf.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n   \\n   \\n \\nFigure 2.1.4: An Example of Display Advertising  \\n(iii) Co-operative Advertising  \\nCo-operative advertising is an agreement between a manufacturer and a distribution chain \\nmember (distributor, wholesaler or retailer). The manufacturer contributes a fixed sum or \\nshares a certain percentage of the member’s advertising. It can also be an agreement between two or more marketers who have complementary products (such as footwear and socks) or different seasonal sales cycles (such as winter co ats and raincoats) to promote or sell each \\nother’s products with their own.  \\nCooperative advertising serves as a unique and powerful tool for small businesses, especially for those who have limited means to support the advertising campaigns required for the  \\nsurvival and success of the business. The joint efforts of marketers in such cooperative agreements broaden the scope of distribution and the quality of advertising campaign. Such kind of advertising helps small companies to link their names with the ones  which are \\nnationally recognised. Smaller companies or start -ups use this type of advertising to attract \\nloyal customers of popular brands.  \\nGiven so many benefits, cooperative advertisements have few drawbacks as well. Small business houses should complet ely understand the commitment involved before finalising the \\nagreement. Sometimes huge corporate giants may demand for high level of quality or certain style of advertising which may be difficult to achieve in a limited budget.

The basic objective of product advertising is to increase brand awareness and demonstrat e the \\ndifferences between the product and its competitors. A good advertising campaign educates the potential buyers on why they might need the product, how can they use it and what benefits they will receive.  \\nMarket research is usually conducted to obtai n information such as the requirements of the \\ntarget audience, factors which influence the buying decisions, preferred media to distribute the information about the product. The collected data is then used to write an advertisement \\nmessage and convince the  potential buyers to buy the product. For example , as shown in \\nfigure 2.1.6 Heinz uses superior quality of tomatoes to prepare ketchup than their \\ncompetitors.  \\n \\n \\n48 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\ad_pdf.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The basic idea here is that more times an advertisement is projected, it stays in the top of mind consciousness for the customer and they  are likely to \\nmake a purchase decision. This is an effective way of advertising; however, it’s a costly affair \\nfor the sponsor to successfully pull the target audience. The time and expenses involved in \\nsuch advertisements are not a problem for big brands  as they have massive advertising \\nbudgets and product lines are planned in advance. The small businesses face budget constraints when they try to imitate big brands in this type of marketing. Direct response marketing evokes an immediate response and compels the target audience to take some specific actions.

Trade advertising is strategically \\nimportant as it establishes good relations with the traders, wholesalers and distributors associated with the selling of a company’s brands. The advantage of trade advertising is that it is cost -effective and provides a better means to communicate with the target audience. Trade \\nadvertisements create an image in the trader’s mind, which eventually compels him/her to approach the company to sell its product.

It \\nconveys mass marketing effort. The objective of national advertising is to inform and remind consumers about the brand and the company. The advertisements intend to communicate the features, benefits and uses of the brand.  \\nNational advertisements are broadcasted on televisions, radios, newspapers, magazines, billboards and the Internet. National advertising is an expensive affair;  therefore, it is carried \\nout by large and well -funded companies such as Coke, Pepsi, Procter &Gamble, Johnson & \\nJohnson etc. The companies intending for national advertisements identify a specific target audience and then build a brand image. Companies so metimes introduce new brands and \\nemphasise on brand loyalty for the established ones through national advertising. The following advertisements highlights the new flavours of ice -cream introduced by Mc Donald’s \\nin Moscow.  \\n \\nFigure 2.1.18: An Example of Nat ional Advertising  \\n(ii) Local Advertising  \\nLocal advertising helps in delivering relevant messages and information to the target audience who are based locally.

These small business houses or local businesses contact consumers though \\nemails, in -town events, advertisements in local channels or newspapers.  \\nPeople prefer to eat and shop near their homes or around their vicinity as it saves time and is more convenient. Therefore, successful local advertisement campaigns hope not only to attract new customers but to showcase a significant presence in the minds of their existing \\nconsumers. Local advertising campaigns might use different strategies in order to build their awareness and reputation within a neighbourhood. Given below are some local adver tising \\nstrategies:  \\na. Local business houses may distribute leaflets and handouts to announce their opening, sales promotions, discounts and coupons.  \\nb. Host or sponsor local events such as a football match or a yoga programme.  \\nc. Participate in social gatherings and community fairs.  \\nd. Purchase local ad space — may be local newspaper, hoardings at bus stops or banners \\nat outdoor spaces etc.  \\ne. Restaurants can offer special lunch deals to the employees of nearby local \\norganisations.  \\nLocal advertising is actually about kn owing and interacting with neighbours and people in the \\nvicinity. It is more about developing relationships than investing money. This requires small businesses to actually move out from their offices and interact with prospective consumers.  \\n \\nFigure 2.1.1 9: An Example of Local Advertising \\n \\n \\n60 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\ad_pdf.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n   \\n   \\n(iii) Global Advertising  \\nGlobal advertising is a communication strategy where a company employs to drive demands \\nfor its goods and services in international or global markets. Global advertising strategies are adapted and  tailor -made to suit the cultural differences and preferences in the international \\nscenarios. The term globalisation was popularised by Ted Levitt (a marketing professor at Harvard Business School) as a concept in marketing and advertising. Levitt observed that \\nregardless of deep rooted cultural differences, people are becoming globally harmonised. He \\nproposed a new paradigm to standardise goods and advertise globally. This would help the \\ncompanies to achieve huge economies of scale, sales volume and market  shares.  \\nAlthough global advertising benefits are attractive, market variances do exist in terms of cultural differences, legal restrictions and media availability. Companies prefer to choose and implement different advertising strategies based on the mark et variations. For instance, the \\nmenu of Mc Donald’s varies based on the geographical location of a restaurant. People in India do not prefer to eat beef and pork, therefore Mc Donald’s Indian menu does not any of \\nthese meat dishes. Instead based on the pr eferences of consumers, new menu is added which \\nincludes aalo (potato), paneer (cottage cheese), egg -stuffed burgers and others.  \\nThe example from Dove campaigns depict that despite cultural differences, the ladies all over \\nthe world thank Dove for taking care of their hair and skin health.  \\n \\nFigure 2.1.20: An Example of Global Advertising  \\n \\n \\n61 \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\ad_pdf.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

Modern \\nadvertisers have an array of choices at their disposal.  \\no Successful advertising campaigns spread the information about a brand, attract prospective customers and generate sales. There are different types of advertisements where a brand can be advertised.  \\no Classified advertisements are cheaper in comparison to large display ads used by \\nbusinesses. These ads are typical ly short, as they are charged based on per line. \\nThese are not widespread as large display ads. They do not include any graphics.  \\no Display advertising basically appears in websites. These advertisements can be in \\ndifferent formats and they have items such as text, images, flash, audio, videos and others.  \\no Co-operative advertising is an agreement between a manufacturer and a \\ndistribution chain member (distributor, wholesaler or retailer).  \\no Product advertising is any form of communication about the promotion of any product or service through which potential customers are convinced to purchase \\nthe product.  \\no Direct response advertising attempts to remind customers about the product and services offered by a particular brand.  \\no Periodical advertising refers to adve rtisements which are published in any \\nmagazines, newspapers or anything that comes out at regular intervals.  \\no As brochures, leaflets, handouts, flyers etc. are usually placed within pages of \\nnewspapers and magazines, they are treated as a separate entity.  \\no Direct mail advertising refers to printed ads being mailed directly to the \\nconsumers.  \\no Broadcast media advertising includes television and radio advertising.

This chapter focuses on information that is needed \\non the industry and the market in which a company plans to focus its \\nstrategic marketing efforts.\\nTheodore Levitt’s seminal work on marketing myopia stated that \\nrailroads were not in trouble in the 1970s because the need for moving \\n people and products had diminished. Railroads were in trouble because \\nthey viewed themselves as being in the railroad business instead of being \\nin the transportation business. \\nUsing Clayton Christensen’s theories on disruptive innovation, new \\nforms of transporting people and products were not a disruptive innova -\\ntion focused on providing the railroad’s least profitable customers with a \\n“good enough” product. Rather, these new forms of transportation were \\na sustaining technology that would have allowed railroad industry leaders \\nthe ability to better serve their most profitable customers.\\nIn this case, we are suggesting that railroads are in the transportation \\nbusiness, and the ability to provide transportation services to augment \\nrailroad delivery might be an option to consider when developing a strat -\\negy. Clearly if the industry focus is too narrow, some options will not be \\nconsidered.\\nThe same is true of identifying the potential market. If a marketing \\nstrategist defines the market too narrowly, potential customers will be \\noverlooked. Consider Southwest Airlines, one of the few airlines to con -\\nsistently show a profit.

This dramatically increased the size of the market \\nand redefined the potential parameters of a marketing strategy.\\nUsing Information to Create a Competitive Advantage\\nOnce the strategist is comfortable with the definition of the industry it \\nis necessary to begin studying the market and the potential competitors.\\nInformation on the market and the competition is readily available if \\nyou know where to look. Information on the market is available through \\ncensus data, industry data, and consumer research. Most of this is readily \\navailable on the Internet.\\nData on the competition is also readily available. Some of the infor -\\nmation can be taken from financial reports if the competitor is a publicly \\ntraded company. These reports usually give key statistics, profiles of key \\nmanagers, and basic financial data.\\nInformation on competitors can also be gathered from customers, \\nvendors, and public records. Developing financial profiles of a competi -\\ntor’s business can also provide valuable information.\\nThis information can point to some strengths and weaknesses of the \\ncompetitors, opportunities and threats in the market place, in the envi -\\nronment, and customer profiles.\\nFollowing are a couple of examples that underscore how specific \\ninformation can be gathered and can help in developing a competitive \\nadvantage.\\nThe Houston Post\\nIn late 1994, newspapers were confronted with rapidly rising newsprint \\ncosts. I was the Financial Director at the Houston Chronicle  at the time. \\nWe decided that although we had good relationships with suppliers and \\nstrong contracts through our parent company, Hearst, it would be import -\\nant to project future newsprint rate increases and develop advertising and \\ncirculation rate increase programs. As a result, the Chronicle  announced \\nthat it would have three 8 percent rate increases: one in September 1994, \\none in January 1995, and one in June 1995.', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' INDUSTr Y AND MArKET  5\\nWe were concerned about our major competitor, the Houston Post . \\nThey, of course, could decide not to increase their ad or circulation rates \\nand gain market share.\\nI had been tracking the ad linage each day for the Houston Post  by \\npurchasing their newspaper and measuring the ads. I estimated their ad \\nrates based on what we learned from customers who bought ads from \\nthe Post. Making assumptions based on circulation and the size of their \\norganization, I was able to have a pretty good idea of the Post’s revenues, \\nexpenses, and contribution margin. My projections showed that the Post \\nhad a small contribution margin and my guess was that they too would \\nincrease ad rates for two reasons. First, they would increase ad rates to \\naccommodate the rise in newsprint costs and second, they would increase \\nad rates because local advertisers wanted two major newspapers compet -\\ning against each other to hold ad rates down.\\nOne of the interesting things I learned while doing the research was \\nthat the Post did not have long-term newsprint agreements with the manu-\\nfacturers and was buying newsprint on the spot commodities market. This \\nmeant their newsprint costs would be much more volatile than ours. This \\nmade it even more likely that they would increase their ad rates in concert \\nwith our announced rate increases.\\nUnbelievably, the Post announced that they would not increase ad \\nrates and the Chronicle  reports of rising newsprint costs were inaccu -\\nrate. As soon as this announcement was made, I went to the Chronicle’s  \\nPresident, Gene McDavid, and said that I could not see the Post making \\nit for another six months using that strategy. Clearly newsprint rates \\nwere going up and if the Post were able to gain more advertising by not \\nraising rates they would require more newsprint at volatile spot market \\nrates.\\nInterestingly, in April 1995, the Chronicle  bought the assets of the Post \\nand Houston became a major newspaper town.\\nCreating a pricing strategy for advertising and circulation during this \\ntime was dependent upon gathering quality information on the market \\nand the competition. The sources of information had to be reliable. News -\\nprint rate increase information came from the vendors selling newsprint \\nwith which the Chronicle  had outstanding relationships.

This provides \\ncost savings to the advertiser. ADVO, a direct mail company that was \\npurchased by Valassis Communications in 2007, became a leader in pro -\\nviding this type of advertising package nationwide. During the 1980s, \\nmany retailers moved their circular advertising out of newspapers and \\ninto ADVO’s marriage mail program.\\nHouston newspapers lost virtually all of the grocery advertising to \\nADVO in the mid-1980s. Prior to ADVO, grocery advertising had been \\na key advertising revenue source for the Houston Chronicle .\\nI led the effort to create a product to compete with the ADVO pro -\\ngram. It seemed that the Chronicle  would be able to combine mail delivery \\n(for non-newspaper subscribers) with newspaper delivery (for newspa -\\nper subscribers) and provide an advertising product similar to ADVO’s \\n product that would be less expensive, since circulars could be added to \\nnewspapers without increasing the delivery costs.\\nIn the information gathering process, we discovered that ADVO \\nearned low postal rates by providing saturation coverage (covering \\n100 percent of the households). ADVO also saved costs by eliminating \\nthe mail labels on each package (each package had the same contents and \\nwent to every house, thereby eliminating the need for a label and making \\ndelivery very easy for the post office).\\nWe knew that by combining newspaper delivery with mail delivery, \\nwe would need to provide each mailed package with an address label since \\nno area would consist of only mail or only newspaper delivery.

That is, since we knew the addresses of subscribers \\nand mail delivered nonsubscribers, we could have different circulars in \\neach package. For advertisers, this meant that they could have different \\nadvertising circulars for different neighborhoods or subdivisions or spe -\\ncific addresses. This was a feature that could not be offered by ADVO \\nwith the undifferentiated, unlabeled marriage mail packages.\\nOver the course of a year or so following the development of the \\nnewspaper and labeled mail program, the Chronicle  won back all of the \\ngrocery advertisers and has held that advertising category to this day.\\nThe success of this program resulted from gathering information on \\nthe competitor’s product and developing a complete understanding of the \\nsales and production process. This information led to the development of \\na program for the Houston Chronicle  that grew to be one of its key revenue \\nsources.\\nI now teach marketing strategy courses to undergraduate and MBA \\nstudents at the University of Houston’s C. T. Bauer College of Business. \\nThese classes are divided into teams and work with real clients to develop \\nspecific marketing strategies during the semester. The first half of the \\nsemester is devoted to gathering information on the market, the com -\\npetition, the company, and the environment.

How can you take advantage of the next wave of \\nbusiness opportunities?\\nClearly, if you can answer these questions you are well on your way to \\nbecoming the next billionaire. Since finding the answers will be challeng -\\ning it is important to identify a process to review industries and businesses \\nand discover indicators that might identify opportunities.\\nClayton Christensen’s theories on disruptive innovations can provide \\nsome insights. His theories show that disruptive innovations often are \\ncreated when an industry leader’s product has been improved to the point \\nthat a significant share of the market’s customers do not want or need all \\nof the product’s attributes. This allows a new market entrant to provide \\na lower cost good enough product that does not have all of the bells and \\nwhistles of the industry leader’s product.\\nThis new entrant will attract the least profitable customer of the \\nindustry leader and be somewhat protected since it will be difficult for \\nthe industry leader to create strategies focused on its most profitable cus -\\ntomer (wants all the bells and whistles) and its least profitable customers \\nat the same time.\\nThe new market entrant, as a result, is allowed to grow its customer \\nbase by attracting more customers who are satisfied with a good enough \\nproduct. Over time, the new entrant improves its offerings and attracts \\nmore customers from the market leader.\\nTo use this principle to spot emerging opportunities requires a bit \\nof research and the ability to identify potential market disruptions. The \\nrecommended steps are as follows:\\n1. Identify markets ripe for disruption:  A market ripe for disruption \\nis one where the profits are very high and the mid-to-lower profit \\nrange customer base growth is at a point where it is stagnating or \\npossibly shrinking. This is an indication that the products provided \\nmight have reached the point where customers may not want or need \\nall of the attributes offered or that the price is reaching an unaccept -\\nable or unsustainable level. An example might be the health care ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Further the costs \\nare driving up insurance costs to the point where insurance is difficult \\nto afford. While the total market for health care remains large and \\nthe demand is high, the lower profit segment is stagnating and some \\nare foregoing all but critical health care. The Affordable Health Care \\nAct may bring insurance costs down and make health care available \\nto a larger segment of the population. This will likely spur techno -\\nlogical solutions for health care and provide market opportunities \\nfor good enough products that are effective such as a mobile phone \\napplication that allows a clinical assistant to provide a diagnosis and \\ntreatment for certain noncritical maladies.\\n2. Identify new market entrants that are focused on the indus -\\ntry’s least profitable customers:  New entrants would be providing \\nproducts that are less expensive than those provided by the industry \\nleaders. For health care, it might be the clinics operated by nurses \\nthat are located in grocery stores and drug stores. Another entrant for \\nhealth care might be the telemedicine technologies that can provide \\ndiagnosis and some treatment protocols via telecommunications. \\nFor retailers, a disruptive technology was rural free delivery (RFD) \\nmail service that spawned the catalog business in the late 1800s.\\n3. Make sure that the new entrants are disruptors:  There are certain \\nnew technologies that might appear to be market disruptors, but are \\nin fact sustaining technologies that can be used by market leaders \\nto better serve their best customers. The Internet, for example, is \\nconsidered a disruptive technology for the newspaper business. The \\nproblem with this conclusion is that the Internet market entrants \\ntargeted the newspapers’ most profitable customers. This, in the \\nshort run, had a significant impact on newspapers but it also allowed \\nnewspapers the ability to focus on counter strategies. That is, the new \\nentrant did not focus on the least profitable customers that would \\nhave created a dilemma for the newspapers to have to abandon very \\nprofitable customers to protect a marginally profitable customer base. \\nThe result is that newspapers and media companies have integrated \\nthe Internet into their businesses and are beginning to develop new \\ndigital strategies.', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

I have seen good sales people put \\na very high probability that the sale would close based on this kind of \\ncustomer feedback.\\nThis can result in overly optimistic sales projections, which can have \\nall sorts of negative consequences for an organization, including over -\\nestimating market share based on inflated sales projections. If a market \\nis defined by faulty assumptions, the outcome will probably not meet \\nexpectations.\\nFor example, one business associate said that he was approached by \\none of the world’s largest manufacturers of a new electrical product to \\nbe their distributor in the United States.

Hepatitis B \\naffects the entire population thus suggesting that the vaccine should be \\nadministered to males and females.

Thus the vaccine must be administered \\nbefore individuals become sexually active.\\nThis vaccine is well publicized and in the United States is highly con -\\ntroversial because of connotations associated with the HPV being a sex -\\nually transmitted disease. As a result, use of the HPV vaccine has found \\nvehement opposition from religious and political groups based on the \\nsexual nature of the disease.\\nMy friend calls the HPV vaccine problem the biggest marketing \\nblunder of all time.

This may be financial cost \\nincurred for changes in the customer’s facilities or mode of operations or \\nsimply the difference in price of the products. Opportunity costs may \\nalso come into play if a customer has to forego opportunities to adopt \\na new product. This analysis assumes that price is the critical factor to \\ncause a customer to change. If customer service, guarantees, maintenance, \\nand other nonprice issues are important, then additional analyses will be \\nrequired.\\nAccording to this type of analysis, when there is no cost to the \\ncustomer to change then there is equilibrium . This result assumes that \\nthe customer could change to an alternative product and incur no costs \\nassociated with the change.\\nWhen the cost to the customer to change is greater than the price \\ncharged then there is a positive equilibrium  relationship, which may \\nprovide the current product provider the ability to increase the price of \\nthe product and thereby increase the profitability without jeopardiz -\\ning the relationship with the customer as long as a positive equilibrium \\nstate is maintained. Again this assumes that price is the critical factor. \\nIf other factors are important and the ability to deliver those factors to the \\ncustomer difficult, then increasing the price to the customer could cause \\nthe customer to consider other vendors.\\nWhen the cost to the customer to change is less than the price charged \\nthen there is a negative equilibrium  relationship, which could provide \\nthe customer a reason to find a substitute product or service.

The downside of this move might be \\nthat there are key advertisers in the negative equilibrium or equilibrium \\ncategories (these advertisers could move away from the newspaper at no \\ncost or actually save money) who would now face competition from the \\nnewly attracted underpotential advertiser. This situation might result in \\nkey customers diverting ad dollars to other media or require a price (and \\nprofit) reduction by the newspaper for key customers in the negative \\nequilibrium or equilibrium categories.\\nAnother example might be a consumer who purchased groceries at a \\nnew store offering very low special pricing. As soon as this pricing reverts \\nto the higher, nonpromotional pricing, the consumer will return to the \\nretailer in which a positive equilibrium relationship exists.\\nIn both of these instances, it might be better to use a marketing strat -\\negy to attract these customers that is not based on price.

Most companies used a stage-\\ngate process, which reviewed the product at each stage of development. \\nIf the product met pre-established expectations then the product was \\nallowed to move to the next stage of development.\\nWe created a similar process at the Houston Chronicle , which was then \\nadopted by the Hearst newspaper group. We found that we were able to \\nhave several ideas and projects under review simultaneously and move \\ngood ideas into good products at a very fast pace (see Figure 8.1).\\nIdeas were accepted from anyone. Employees and customers provided \\nthe most actionable ideas. The first step was to evaluate the project in a \\nbroad sense. Did it complement the other businesses we operated and \\ncustomers we served? Could it produce a profit? We chose only projects \\nserving our markets and that would produce at least a 30 percent oper -\\nating margin.\\nThe next step was to screen projects based on their ability to create \\nnew revenue streams. This would require that they would create a market \\ndemand, be easy for our sales force to present to new and established \\ncustomers, and fit well with our product mix and our operating systems.\\nWe also considered the product’s gateway capacity  or its ability to \\ngenerate additional products. For example, one of the reasons we chose \\nto develop a relationship with the Spanish language publication La Voz  \\nwas its ability to provide access to the Hispanic market and ultimately \\nproduce an array of products for that market.\\nThe La Voz project not only filled the goal of reaching the Hispanic \\nmarket but also taught us how to work with niche print publishers. Over \\nthe next few years the Chronicle  entered into printing and distribution \\nrelationships with several niche publishers.\\nDefining Potential Actions\\nHaving the right offerings that best meet the market needs at a price that \\nis acceptable to customers and provides profitable cash flows for the orga -\\nnization requires a well thought-out product assessment process.', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

The new technologies allow new methods of reaching \\npotential customers and new marketing techniques provide different \\napproaches to segmenting groups into meaningful audiences.

These are but a few of the jobs that may need to be \\naccomplished and they each may require a different mode of advertising. \\nThe media that will work best will depend on the audience to be reached. \\nIt is likely that an advertiser will need to use several media.

Matching each of the advertiser’s \\ncustomer groups using these characteristics with the appropriate media \\nimproves the chances that the targeted advertising message will reach the \\nright audience.\\nIt is important to note that a company’s established customer base \\nmay have a different demographic profile than a new customer base that \\nis targeted. For example, an Internet game developer may have an estab -\\nlished audience that is young, single, and at the early stages of a career. \\nThis developer may also want to find a market in the business community \\nfor a program that allows business professionals to test various market \\nscenarios. Reaching these two audiences will require considerable thought \\nto message design and media choice.\\nDetermine the Budget\\nIt is important to understand the amount of money available to accom -\\nplish the task set for the advertising project. Companies usually know \\nwhat they need accomplished and they know what their ad expenditures \\nare to be kept within a certain budget.\\nThe question becomes: How do you compare the cost of advertising \\nbetween the various media?

For example, an advertiser wishing to strengthen its image \\nas reliable to current customers and present an image of innovation to \\nattract new customers simply means that the message should translate to \\nboth audiences and be promoted using media that reach both audiences. \\nThis synergistic approach tends to improve media effectiveness while con -\\ntrolling ad campaign costs.\\nMoving an Audience to Act\\nStarting with the consumer adoption drivers (CADs) discussed in the \\nprevious chapter should provide some direction in developing commu -\\nnication to targeted customer segments. For instance, in the luxury auto -\\nmobile example, it appeared that group influence was important to key \\ncustomers in positive equilibrium and of low importance to customers \\nin negative equilibrium. It also appeared that both groups found that \\ntangible differentiability was of high importance. One potential commu -\\nnication strategy then might be to create ads that focused on the physical \\nattributes of the car. This would avoid any potential conflict from using \\nindividuals in the ads portraying roles of peers to the targeted audience.\\nOnce the advertising approach is determined, the strategy of media \\nand use comes into play.\\nSince advertising is the primary method for businesses to inform \\nand influence individuals to consider and purchase their products, ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",

These stages \\nare (1) unawareness, (2) awareness, (3) comprehension, (4) conviction, \\nand (5) action.\\nIf bringing an audience from the stage of unawareness to the final \\nstage of action is the goal, the frequency of exposure to an advertising \\nmessage will be much higher than that which is required for just moving \\nthe audience from conviction to action.\\nMoving through all five stages probably would involve a product or \\nconcept that is new to the audience and the initial communication would \\nhave to educate the audience. The more complicated the product or con -\\ncept, the greater the education requirements will be. For example, intro -\\nducing a new drink to a market familiar with drink products will require \\nless education than introducing insurance to an audience unfamiliar with \\nthe concept.\\nMoving from conviction to action is seemingly the easiest and should \\nrequire the least number of messages to result in favorable action. This \\nhowever is not necessarily the case. An individual may know there is a need \\nfor a product but may be hesitant to make a purchase due to budgetary \\nrestraints or the inability to make a choice from many similar products.\\nIdentifying the Audience\\nMost businesses have a good idea of the composition of the target audi -\\nence to receive advertising messages. The managers know the products, \\ntheir uses, and the intended audiences. The audience demographic pro -\\nfiles can be fairly broad to very specific. For example, introducing a new \\ncomputer would suggest those individuals who use a computer are the \\nintended audience of the ad message for the computer.

If done properly, it unifies the business and marketing \\nstrategies. IKEA, for example, in 1982 stated as its purpose, “To pro -\\nmote and support innovation in the field of architectural and inte -\\nrior design.” Coca Cola’s mission is to “refresh the world.”\\n2. Find ways to get publicity by tying to news articles and getting \\ncoverage:  Be on the lookout for opportunities to comment pub -\\nlicly or through press releases on topics that are germane to your \\nbusiness; for example, Whole Foods recent announcement that by \\n2018, all products in the United States and Canada must be labeled \\nif they contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Find ways of getting publicity by tying your business or idea to \\ngood works: If there are charitable causes or organizations that fit \\nwell with your business model, a strong tie in can provide a boost. \\nAT&T for example has established an office for a Chief Medical \\nInformation Officer that will focus on the use of telecommunications \\nin providing health care. Additionally, AT&T has made numerous \\ncharitable contributions to organizations developing telemedicine \\ntechnologies and procedures. While this is good work by AT&T for \\nthe community, it also positions them as a key player in the minds of \\ntelemedicine innovators.\\n4. Start a blog that provides information that is relevant to your \\nbusiness: A blog that is serious and provides useful information can \\nbuild credibility for your business. American Express’ blog on travel, \\nhttp://www.travelandleisure.com/  provides very useful travel infor -\\nmation that is tied to using the American Express card. Home Depot \\nhas a blog that provides information on home and garden projects.\\n5. Use social network to link to your blog and update your networks \\non recent projects: Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social networks \\nprovide a ready-made avenue to build an audience for your blog and \\nto announce recent developments that may be of interest. Business \\nExpert Press encourages authors to join social networks and to regu -\\nlarly participate in discussions. Since it is a step in the brand building \\nprocess, this approach should be taken seriously.

MFR Consulting recently created a group \\nof senior advisors who have their own business consulting practices. \\nThese senior advisors meet monthly to discuss projects and ways in \\nwhich they can grow the consulting practice.

The concept was unique in that our \\ncompany would attract listings from commercial brokers all over the \\ncountry and present those listings to qualified investment groups located \\nall over the country.\\nSuccess depended on attracting a leading commercial real estate bro -\\nker in each market willing to sign on as an affiliate and feed their listings \\ninto the system.\\nSuccess also depended on qualified investors subscribing to our ser -\\nvices and ultimately purchasing properties through our system.\\nGetting investors to subscribe to the service was relatively simple. If \\nyou were a qualified investor, a small subscription fee would certainly be \\na worthwhile investment.\\nBrokers, on the other hand, had to agree to a significant fee to be the \\nexclusive affiliate in a market and had to be willing to share commissions \\non any property sold through the system.\\nThere was no question that American Property Data was built around \\nthe needs of a commercial broker by providing a means of exposing his \\nor her properties to groups of qualified buyers. This would not only allow \\nthe broker to increase sales but also to attract more listings and attract the \\nbest commercial real estate agents to come work with the broker.\\nAdditionally the broker would not have to change how they operated \\ntheir business.

The pricing strategy will affect the promotion, \\nproduct, and distribution strategies, and must be in keeping with the \\norganization’s vision and mission.\\nTen Considerations for Pricing a Product or Service\\nWhen introducing a new product or service to the market a key, and often \\ncritical, consideration is the price for this offering. I have seen folks sim -\\nply take the cost of production and use a percentage markup as a pricing \\nmodel. This is the simplest model and it provides a good example for the \\nneed to consider other pricing model options.\\nHere are 10 things to consider before setting a price for your product \\nor service:\\n• Markup based on cost versus retail:  In the opening para -\\ngraph, I gave the example of a model being used that marked \\nup a product by a percentage over the cost. The cost used \\nhere is generally direct cost or labor and materials. If some -\\none wants a 30 percent of the asking price to be marked up, \\nthen using 30 percent of the cost will not provide the desired \\noutcome. Simply put, it is the wrong math. If something costs \\n$1 to make and it is marked up by 30 percent for a selling \\nprice of $1.30, then the profit based on the asking price is \\n23.07 percent. To arrive at a 30 percent markup based on the \\nselling price, it is necessary to divide the cost by its desired \\npercentage of the selling price; in this case, $1 divided by its \\ndesired percentage of the selling price or 70 percent. Thus ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='76 DEVELOPING SUCCESSFUL MArKETING STrATEGIES\\n$1/0.7 = $1.43. Here the markup is $0.43 and is equal to \\n30 percent of the selling price. I know this seems simple but \\nI can tell you that it is a common mistake that is made by a \\nlot of business pricing strategists.\\n• Competition:  It may not matter what you want to charge if \\nyour product has competition from similar offerings in the \\nmarketplace with similar capabilities. The price offered by the \\ncompetition will have a significant influence on the price you \\nwill be able to charge unless you can find a way to differen -\\ntiate your company or the product from the competition. \\nOffering financing, volume pricing, or other supporting pro -\\ngrams such as training or superior support services can accom -\\nplish this. If differentiation is not an option, then a review \\nof the manufacturing and marketing processes may allow a \\nreduction in the cost structure that, in turn, allows a greater \\nprofit per product sold even in a competitive environment.\\n• Alternative options:  One of the major drawbacks of focusing \\non the cost of producing a product is the lack of focus on \\nthe alternatives that may be available to the customer. This \\ncan work for or against a pricing strategist. For example, in \\none company we developed a process for providing a service \\nto deliver printed circulars in the newspaper and through \\nthe mail for considerably less than could be provided by any \\ncompetitor offering the same service. One thought was to \\nprice the service with a small markup above our direct costs. \\nThis would certainly have drawn a lot of customers to our \\nservice but would have overlooked the possibility of pricing \\njust below the competition or possibly above the competition \\nand maximizing our profits. In the end we priced slightly \\nbelow the competition, maximized our profits, and won the \\nmajority of the customers in the market.\\n• Budget:  In every pricing situation, the customers’ budget has \\nto be a major consideration. If, for example, the typical cus -\\ntomer spends 2 percent of their budget on products or services \\nthat you offer and your products require most or all of the \\n2 percent, you will be forcing potential customers to evaluate ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 75}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' PrICING  77\\nthe potential expenditure very carefully. Many times to justify \\na large budget allocation, it will require more marking and \\nsupport expenses on your part in order to clearly demonstrate \\nthe value of your offering. The question here is whether this \\napproach will provide more profits or a larger market share \\n(more profits) than competing with a lower price.\\n• Knowledge:  In the early stages of a product life cycle, the \\nconsumer may not be aware of alternatives to your product or \\nservice and may allow the ability to charge a premium price. \\nAs you know, premium pricing and high profits will attract \\ncompetition and competitors will work hard to educate \\nconsumers on alternatives to your offerings. To the extent you \\ncan hold on to the “knowledge differential” through patents \\nor other protections such as capital requirements, you will be \\nable to enjoy premium pricing. Be prepared to have a strategy \\nwhen this advantage is lost. Some companies will schedule \\nnew product launches at the point where their patents expire.\\n• Cost to produce:  As mentioned earlier, a clear understand -\\ning of the costs involved in producing and delivering your \\nproduct or service plays an important role in pricing. Under -\\nstanding the costs well enough to find alternatives to produc -\\ntion or distribution costs can have a significant impact. Back \\nin the days of phone modems, transferring data resulted in \\nhuge long distance telephone bills. One option I found was \\nto work with Western Union and use their satellites to dis -\\nseminate information around the country. This was done by \\nusing a local phone connection to Western Union and a small \\nmonthly charge for the use of the satellite. In another situa -\\ntion, I found that I could use strategic allies in other markets \\nto represent my firm’s products and services, thereby avoiding \\ncosts for expanding to other markets. This reduction in cost \\nallowed us to attract customers who wouldn’t have been inter -\\nested in the higher pricing that would have been necessary \\nwith the higher cost structures.\\n• Cost to market:  Marketing costs can easily represent \\n50 percent of a product’s cost.

Grassroots \\nmarketing through local community groups has provided \\nsome firms a way of introducing products to key individuals \\nwho become fans and product promoters.\\n• Funding for operations:  One of the drawbacks to pricing a \\nproduct based on its direct costs of labor and materials is the \\ninability to properly consider the cost of ongoing administra -\\ntive, manufacturing, and support operations. Here the lack \\nof understanding costs can result in charging a price for a \\nproduct that does not cover the associated increase in admin -\\nistrative costs, repair, and maintenance or capital expendi -\\ntures. One solution is to include an overhead cost factor into \\nthe direct-cost calculations for each product.\\n• Market positioning : It is important to remember that the \\nprice can suggest value to the consumer. Priced too low a \\nproduct can be viewed as poor quality and limited value. \\nHigh pricing can support the image of high-quality product \\nfor discerning customers if all of the other marketing compo -\\nnents are aligned properly.\\n• Availability:  An important consideration in pricing is the \\navailability of the product or service and the ability to find \\nsubstitutes. If there are markets that do not have easy access to \\nproducts, then a premium pricing strategy can be employed. \\nRetailers routinely have higher markups in rural areas where \\ncompetition and product variety are limited.\\nProduct pricing can be critical to a product and ultimately a com -\\npany’s ability to survive and succeed. Approaching pricing as a minor \\nmarketing tool can be dangerous.\\nReacting to the Competition\\nBasing price on a competitor’s pricing approach is fraught with hazards.\\nI have worked in several industries and found that pricing is often \\noverlooked as a key marketing tool.

This reac -\\ntion assumes the competition knows the market better and has a superior \\nmarketing strategy.\\nWhen reacting to the competition it is important to understand that \\nyou are being drawn into a game whereby you play by the competitor’s \\nrules. You are playing their game and changing your strategy. Your hope \\nhere is that you can play the game better or that the competitors can’t play \\ntheir own game very well.\\nI am reminded of a time where my company was vying for the busi -\\nness of a key customer. The customer was a shrewd negotiator. We under -\\nstood the value of the customer but valued profit and the perception that \\nour product commanded a higher price. The customer, we knew, would \\nuse the price bids to play the competitors against each other.\\nOur belief was that this was a no-win strategy and decided to bid the \\nprice to the point where we would make very little profit and then let the \\ncompetitor win the bid. We felt that winning the bid was the end game \\nfor our competitor and we took the risk that they would lower the price \\nuntil they won the contract.\\nFortunately, we were right; the competition won the contract but \\ncouldn’t provide the needed level of service.

This approach usually fails if the \\nproduct is designed for a specialized use or if the marketing strategy is \\ndesigned to differentiate the product from others in the marketplace. For \\ndifferentiated products, the volumes and profits might increase with a \\nprice reduction but the value of the efforts to differentiate the product \\nis lost.\\nPricing Based on Direct Costs\\nMarking up a product based on its direct cost may not capture the full \\nvalue of the product. \\nPricing can be based on the information provided by cost account -\\ning that if variable or direct costs are covered then profits can be made. \\nThis is indeed valuable information but pricing based on direct costs only \\nconcerns itself with the costs of direct materials and labor to produce the \\nproduct. This strategy is often used when adding a new product to the \\nproduct mix and is influenced by the need to give the new product every \\nopportunity to succeed.\\nIt also heroically assumes that the established product mix covers fixed \\ncosts. This assumption doesn’t account for subtle increases that are diffi -\\ncult to measure such as repair and maintenance costs and administrative \\ncosts, which are usually considered as fixed.\\nPricing a New Product\\nAt one point, I was chairing a new products committee that had devel -\\noped a new product that had a great deal of promise.

I argued that a significantly \\nlower price would not recognize the organizational expense and overhead \\nand could possibly suggest to our customers that our product was not \\nequal to the competition since price is often associated with value.\\nWe chose the higher pricing strategy because we felt our product was \\nsuperior to that of the competition. It took several years to fully penetrate \\nthe market but eventually we did capture the market and enjoyed signifi -\\ncant sales and profit levels.\\nIf we had adopted the direct-cost pricing model we would have been \\nunable to afford the customer training and interface that was required \\nto have a successful product launch.

If the direct-\\ncost model had been used and the quality reduced to allow for customer \\ntraining costs, the customer adoption would have been more problem -\\natic because there would have been less differentiation from the product \\nalready in use by customers.\\nBecause the pricing strategy was based on value, the product never \\nshowed a loss using fully allocated costing models and, in the end, this \\nproduct captured the market and for years has been a major source of \\nrevenue and profit streams.\\nUsing Industry Norms for Pricing\\nUnderstanding industry-pricing norms is critical when entering a new \\nline of business.\\nHouston Chronicle Commercial Printing Pricing\\nThe Houston Chronicle  bought a commercial printing plant and routinely \\nsold printing to their advertisers.

The five steps are as follows:\\n• Design the organization and workforce structure around the \\ngoals of the organization: This is more easily accomplished \\nif you are starting a new business and more difficult for older \\nand more established businesses. It is helpful to envision an \\norganization successfully meeting its goals and think about the \\nstructure and employees driving that organization. Those goals \\ncan be making a certain level of profit, reaching a certain market \\nsegment, being a market leader, providing a certain level of ser -\\nvice, and so on. Many businesses may have all of the aforemen -\\ntioned and more as stated goals. With these goals in mind, it is \\nimportant then to look at the organization’s functional compo -\\nnents, finance, sales and marketing, production, distribution, \\nand research and development, and make certain their goals \\nare aligned with the organization’s goals. For example, having \\nan organizational goal of meeting customers’ specialized needs ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

Here, the production goal might be \\nrestated to find the most efficient method of fulfilling custom -\\ners’ needs. Sales and marketing in this instance would need to \\nfocus on working with customers to find solutions that effi -\\nciently meet their needs. This allows the organization to strive to \\nmeet the customers’ specialized needs while providing efficiently \\ndesigned customer solutions to the production department. \\nThis will almost always require open communication channels \\nbetween the organization’s functional components.\\n• Clearly articulate goals : Beginning with the hiring process, \\nkeep the organization’s goals in mind. If the organization is \\nstructured properly, then the workforce positions in each of \\nthe functional components will support the overall organiza -\\ntional goals. In the previous example, marketing secretaries \\nwill understand the kinds of services being offered and know \\nhow to direct traffic to the right marketing individual. Pro -\\nduction personnel will constantly be on the lookout for more \\nefficient methods to produce quality outcomes. Accountants \\nwill focus on tracking costs and providing information to \\nimprove the organization’s ability to provide the best service \\ncompetitively while generating acceptable profit levels.\\n• Design training around organizational goals:  T raining new \\nemployees and retraining long-term employees will have to \\nbe focused on meeting organizational goals. Here customer \\nfocus is very important. If employees can see how they fit into \\na process that successfully addresses a customer’s needs, then \\nthey are more likely to be engaged reaching organizational \\ngoals. I have been involved in an organization that was large \\nand well established but operated on internal departmental \\ngoals that built resentment and reduced cooperation between \\ndepartments.

Using the previous example, if \\nproduction personnel were rewarded on low cost per item \\nproduced and sales and marketing were rewarded for market \\nshare improvement and the overall organizational goals were \\nto meet customers’ specialized needs, there would likely be \\nfriction between departments and dissatisfied customers. \\nOn the other hand, if both departments were rewarded for \\nachieving market share growth and improved profitability, \\nthen the organization and the customer are more likely to be \\nsuccessful.\\n• Be careful about adding new jobs and new functions: \\nEvery new job or organizational function should be evalu -\\nated on its ability to help the organization achieve its goals. \\nExecutives and department managers can be very persuasive \\nwhen requesting additional resources. It is important to use \\norganizational goals as the metric to determine the need for \\nthe additional resources.\\n• Develop extracurricular activities to support organiza -\\ntional goals:  When developing programs to engage personnel \\nand build relationships with customers, it is important to \\nkeep organizational goals in mind. It will be hard for employ -\\nees or customers to see how lavish parties promote efficiency. \\nOn the other hand, well thought-out social events can \\nbuild relationships that foster good customer relations and \\nemployee morale and focus.\\nThe aforementioned process is fairly simple but requires daily focus. \\nI have found that when orchestrated properly, it results in an organization \\nthat routinely exceeds expectations, customers who are satisfied, and a \\nworkforce that is self-directed and motivated.\\nOrganizational Structures for a New Business\\nI have recently been involved in two start-ups that may prove as useful \\nexamples for a less structured, more evolutionary approach for developing \\norganizational structures.', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 100}),\n",

The best structure would be one that \\nallowed continued support from the founding institutions while allowing \\nthe ability to attract public and private funding for the new organization.\\nWhile the direction follows my recommended approach, it differs in \\nthe ability to easily identify a clear strategic plan.

One challenge was the presses owned by \\nthe newspaper. The presses that printed the newspaper used the letterpress \\nprocess, which didn’t produce the quality provided by the offset process \\nused by commercial printers. To address this, the newspaper purchased a \\nprinting company that had heat-set offset printing presses.

This limited the ability to sell smaller \\nprint jobs. To address this, the newspaper used smaller commercial print -\\ners to print the jobs sold by the newspaper’s sales staff.\\nThis is where culture got in the way. The newspaper had an approved \\nlist of two or three outside printing vendors that could be used. These \\nprinters had long-standing relationships with the newspaper. Their prices \\nwere well above market prices, thereby limiting the sales to those in des -\\nperate need or who were not knowledgeable of printing prices. At times, \\nthe newspaper would bundle advertising with printing and discount \\nthe advertising to offset cost of the printing. Since the newspaper was \\nthe primary advertising vehicle at the time, this approach generated a \\nrespectable amount of revenue but provided less profit than just selling \\nadvertising. \\nThis approach was the result of a culture that emphasized the newspa -\\nper’s leadership position in the marketplace. Basically, it said to staff and \\nultimately to the market that the newspaper set the rules, not the market -\\nplace. All too often a request made by a customer was simply turned away \\ndue to lack of capacity or inability to meet the customer’s needs.\\nThere is a huge chasm between identifying the need for a cultural \\nshift and actually causing a cultural shift.

Further, when we sent a \\nproduction manager to collect materials as they were produced we found \\nthat scanning the artwork was slowing down the process.\\nThe production manager called one of the printing vendors and \\nalerted them of the situation. Scanning was dropped in favor of a flatbed \\ncamera. This and a few other production process changes allowed us to \\nget the customers’ circular into their mailboxes on that Thursday.\\nThis kind of service led to the ability to advise customers on all of \\ntheir advertising and ad production needs.

If old value networks (processes, procedures, commu -\\nnication channels, and protocols) govern, then survival in a changing \\nmarketplace becomes more difficult.\\nThis is a dilemma that is the result of dated value networks becoming \\npart of a hardwired approach to problem solving within the industry. \\nThese are hardwired in the sense that they are part of the culture and very \\ndifficult to change.\\nMost companies require innovations to create new revenue and profit \\nstreams for growth and long-term success. Innovation is needed for devel -\\noping new products or finding new markets for current products. Either \\napproach requires new strategies and is based on innovative thinking.

This meant a high variable or direct cost and would require \\nsignificant revenue streams. These revenue streams would not be possible \\nto generate from the growing number of small businesses that wanted to \\nfocus on the immediate markets around their business location.\\nPresented with this information and with some study of what was \\nbeing done in other markets, the task group suggested that a group of lim -\\nited circulation products be developed for small businesses. A local com -\\nmercial printer would print these products on smaller presses. Advertising \\npricing would be lower due to reduced costs, and distribution would be \\nin several zones. Each zone would cover a specific area of the city where a \\ngroup of businesses and their potential customers were located.\\nWhat was revealing about the task group approach was the immediate \\nbuy-in by each of the participants into finding a solution to a business \\nchallenge.

ADVO, a direct marketer established in 1929, bought \\nMarriage Mailers in 1979 and began rolling out the program nationwide.\\nUntil the introduction of marriage mail, advertising circulars were \\nprimarily distributed by newspapers and represented a very profitable rev -\\nenue stream. Newspapers at the time did not feel the need to lower their \\nrates for circular distribution because they felt they had a superior delivery \\nsystem. Some retailers felt otherwise and began using the marriage mail \\nconcept, and over the next 20 years, newspapers lost the majority of gro -\\ncery inserts to marriage mail.\\nHouston had become one of ADVO’s most profitable markets to \\nthe detriment of the Houston Post  and Houston Chronicle . In 1993, I was \\ncharged with creating a mail product for the Houston Chronicle  that would \\ncompete with ADVO.\\nSince the project would require support from across the organization, \\nI decided to create a cross-functional team to put together a response. \\nThis team met every Friday morning for the remainder of my tenure at \\nthe Houston Chronicle . By early 1994, we had created a product that was \\ndelivered to newspaper subscribers in the newspaper and to the remainder \\nof the market through the U.S. Postal Service. Due to the mix of delivery, \\nwe were able to offer full market coverage at prices less than those offered \\nby ADVO. The program was in full swing across the Houston Market in \\n1995, and by late 1995 all of the key retailers had abandoned ADVO and \\nmoved to the Chronicle’s  program.\\nThe task force met each week to review the prior week’s performance \\nand address any new issues that arose.

Here are five steps that can improve the workforce building process.\\n1. Screening:  Assembling the right group of individuals for your work -\\nforce is important. You can test for competency but being part of a \\nteam means that individuals must have personalities that can work \\ntogether. Assuredly this means that some subjectivity will enter into \\nthe screening process. It may also mean that wrong choices will \\nbe made and will need correction. The subjectivity and chance for \\nerrors can be reduced with the introduction of 10 tips from About  \\n.com Human Resources at http://humanresources.about.com/od/\\nrecruiting/tp/recruiting_employee.htm\\n2. Defining job responsibilities:  Even with the right personnel, the \\nworkforce can be dysfunctional if each member’s responsibilities are \\nnot clearly defined. It is management’s responsibility to understand \\nhow each job contributes to the organization’s success and to clearly \\narticulate the requirements of each job.\\n3. Defining job success:  After each member of the workforce under -\\nstands the requirements of his or her job, it is important that he or \\nshe understands what success looks like. This can be presented in \\nterms of meeting specific deadlines, producing specific results in pro -\\nduction or sales or levels of customer satisfaction. It is important for \\nindividual members of the organization to understand how success \\nin their job relates to the overall success of the organization.\\n4. Establishing metrics:  Favoritism and  improperly set work rules can \\ndestroy the morale and ultimately the effectiveness of a good work -\\nforce. Setting specific metrics for job performance lets individuals \\nknow how their performance will be graded. If developed properly, ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\Developing-Successful-Marketing-Strategies.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",

The University \\nof California suggests using the following SMART test to determine \\nthe quality of performance metrics.\\nS = Specific : clear and focused to avoid misinterpretation. Should \\ninclude measurement assumptions and definitions and be easily \\ninterpreted.\\nM = Measurable : can be quantified and compared to other data. It \\nshould allow for meaningful statistical analysis. Avoid “yes/no” \\nmeasures except in limited cases, such as start-up or systems-in-\\nplace situations.\\nA = Attainable : achievable, reasonable, and credible under condi -\\ntions expected.\\nR = Realistic : fits into the organization’s constraints and is cost-\\neffective.\\nT = Timely : doable within the time frame given.\\n5. Workforce participation in job design: Most individuals spend the \\nmajority of their time in the workplace. For the highest level of pro -\\nductivity, members of a workforce should feel that they are part of \\nthe organization and can have real input into how jobs are designed. \\nThe workplace can be a site for individual growth and learning as \\nwell as a place to produce goods and services. If individuals under -\\nstand what is needed for the organization to succeed, participation \\nin job design can lead to higher productivity for the organization and \\nhigher morale with lower turnover for the workforce.\\nFinding People to Accomplish the Extraordinary\\nChoosing the right individuals to build an organization is critical.

Utility refers to the want satisfying \\npower of a good or service. Pr oduction creates form utility by transforming the raw materials \\ninto goods and services. Apart from the form utility marketing also creates time, place and \\nownership utility. Time and place utili ty refers to the availability  of the goods and services to \\nthe consumers at the right time and right place. Ownership utility refers to the transfer of the \\nproduct or service from the possession of the pr oducer or the marketer to the possession of \\nthe consumers. \\nThere are different views for the concept of marketing. However, the three basic elements \\nthat can be seen in the definition of marketing are selling, market resear ch and advertising. In \\nbroader terms it is a management process, which identifies, anticipates and satisfies customer \\nrequirements efficiently and pr ofitably. It is a process of planning and executing the \\nconception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods and services to create \\nexchanges that satisfies the individual and or ganisational objectives.

Cha nging trends indicate that \\ncustomers are now rationalizing their supplier base and demanding more \\nsophisticated, tailor made solutions. As a result the cost of serving customers is \\nincreasing. These circumstances have created a need to adopt a different approach \\nto business development and adopting the Key Account Management (KAM) \\napproach. This approach is developed through suppliers and consumers working \\ntogether on a \"win-win\" basis. The em phasis is placed on the profit impact of \\naccount retention and development i.e., \" account lifetime value In implementation \\npoint of view it is a shift from measuring in terms of transactions to quality and \\nlongevity of collaboration. \\n• Supply chain management- It is about mana ging the pipeline that links customers \\nto suppliers.

Marketing control is a four-step process in which: \\n• Standards for performance are set \\n• Progress towards marketing goals are measured \\n• Results compared with the standards \\n• Changes are made or good results ar e reinforced to stay on track. \\nMarketing from the implementatio n point of view is sometimes  thought of as simply the \\nprocess of buying and selling. But its tasks are more extensive than just buying and selling. \\nFor making it operative and effective there are basically three types of functions that the \\norganisation must provide. These are: \\n• Exchange function: This covers buying selling and pr icing. Exchange function is \\ncommonly considered as marketing. This invol ves finding a buyer or a seller, negotiating \\nprice and transforming ownershi p. All these activities take pl ace in the market i.e. the \\nphysical meeting point of the buyers and sellers. \\n• Physical function: Physical function relates to the act ual flow of good s and services \\nthrough space and time from th e producer to the consumer an d their transformation into a \\nform desirable to/the consumers.  This involves  assembling, transport and handling, storage, \\nprocessing and packaging and grading and stan dardization. Assembling the product at a \\nconvenient place allows economical transport. Storage helps in hold ing the product till \\npeak season of demand and stabilizing the supply accordin gly. Processing transforms the \\nproduct into a form desirable to the consumers. Grading and standardization helps the \\nconsumer to be confidant as to th e type of goods they are purchasing. \\n• Facilitating function: This involves financing, risk bearing, market research, market \\n information and creation of demand and supp ly. Financing and risk bearing are the two \\nmost important facilitating functions. Without th e willingness to provide the capital and to \\nbear these costs no stage of the market ch ain can function.

There are a number of analys is and tools that help an \\norganisation use a marketing approach. These include market analysis, user analysis, \\norganisational analysis, competitive analysis and the marketing mix. ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\marketing.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

The most obvious market is the end- users of library services - library patrons, the \\nparent institutions of librari es/information centres, government agencies that provide funds \\nand other institutions that have information needs but no libraries. Both funding and user \\nmarkets should be identified in the market analysis. \\nAfter identifying the markets, it is essential to establish the size of each market and the trends \\naffecting the demand for services. \\nMarket analysis also includes segmenting the to tal market into smaller units with distinct \\nwants and needs. The users of a market segment are similar to one anot her but different from \\nusers in other segments. Severa l criteria are used to segment the library market. Segmentation \\nis further discussed in the next section. \\nUser Analysis  \\nOnce the market has been identified, the marketer must identify the user s within that market. \\nWho can be the user? Is it a library director, th e head of department, the reference librarian, a \\nprofessor, the board of directors, or a student ? It can be any of the above. A useful way by \\nwhich to organize these users is to categorize them as influencers, deciders, purchasers or \\nusers of a service or a product. \\nOrganisational Analysis \\nAs an organisation tries to establish what markets to serve and which products and services \\nto offer, strong consideration must be given to the objectives, strengths and weaknesses of the \\norganisation itself. Considerations in the anal ysis would include resources available to the \\norganisation, restrictions if any, attitudes of authorities, special expertise of staff, structure of \\nthe organisation and successes and failures, if a ny. Assessing the strengt hs of the organisation \\ncan help turn opportunities into successes. \\nCompetitive Analysis  \\nCompetitive analysis begins by identifying as many potential competitors as possible. In fact, \\nidentifying markets will help to identify competito rs and vice versa. Who is the competitor for \\na library/information organi sation? Competitors include other library/information \\norganisations, library associations, for-profit vendors (like information brokers), and library \\nschools. Competitors also include other organisations vying for funding, for example, college \\nlibraries compete with one another for get ting funds from authorities. An organisation \\ncompetes with others who seek funds fr om foundations. As libra ry budgets shrink, the \\ncompetition for limited funds has become intens e, placing information organisations in a \\nhighly competitive environment. \\nCompetitors can be evaluated by identifying the attributes and prices of their services and \\nproducts in comparison with ot hers. The competitive analysis should ask: what market \\nsegment does each competitor concentrate on, what image does each project and how \\nsuccessful is each in satisfying particular wants and needs?

       " Document(page_content=\"Marketing Mix \\nWhile marketing is an approach to long-term pl anning, it can also help make short term plans \\nfor the delivery of particular services to particular markets. A short term tool that helps with \\nplanning is the marketing mix, al so referred to as the four P' s of marketing after its four \\ncomponents namely product, pri ce, place and promotion. This will be discussed in detail in \\nSection 17.6. \\n \\n17.5 : Customer Focus\\nTo benefit the customer a marketing exchange must satisfy a need or a want. A need is a \\nfeeling of deprivation over the absence of some necessity for basic survival whereas a want is \\na desire to satisfy a need in a specific way. Marketers have no contro l over people's needs, \\nbut can influence their wants. Utility is the value a product provides for the customer. \\nMarketers can satisfy customers needs and wants through six types utility. They are. \\n• Form utility- providing finished product after processing the raw material. \\n• Time utility- providing the product at the right time when the customer needs it. \\n• Place utility- making the product available at the right place when they need it. \\n• Possession utility-enabling the customer to obtain and use the product over time. \\n• Information utility- communicating to the customer in formation about the product. \\n• Service utility- providing service on the product over time. \\nNothing is more essential to an organisation than its customers. Organisations are now \\nrealizing the fact that they have to design their business processes centered on the customer. \\nThe current trend is towards relationship marketing, which focuses on developing a close \\nrelationship with the customer. An existing customer costs less to keep than the money and \\neffort required attracting a new customer. Mark eting is not just about making or getting a \\nsale, but about keeping a friend. Therefore it makes sense to stress on long-term relationship \\nwith the customers. \\nThe libraries and information centres are always concerned with satisfying their users. The \\naim is always to obtain a better knowledge of the users of library  and information services by \\nseveral user survey methods. It has, therefore, become essen tial that information managers \\nwould develop an interest in the marketing of their services. \\nIn order to understand user needs several me thods can be employed. Some of these are: \\n• Interview \\n• Questionnaire \\n• Case Study \", metadata={'source': 'files\\\\marketing.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• Observation \\n• Suggestions from users \\nThe user needs, with regard to a product or service can be assessed by any of the methods \\nmentioned above. These enable an information manager/librarian to plan their products and \\nservices to find appropriate users or to find a proper place in the society. \\nGone are the days when services of libraries/i nformation centres would have users coining to \\nseek the services. Presently, the library manage rs view their services as businesses and are \\nemploying appropriate marketing strategies to ensure their development and improve their \\neffectiveness. In other words, the requirements/ needs of users are determined or identified \\nand then services are provided to satisfy these requirements/needs; \\n \\n17.6 : Marketing Mix\\nTo achieve marketing objectives a strategy need s to be worked out which includes different \\nelements that are product, place, promotion and price. These elements are commonly referred \\nto, as 4 Ps of marketing are controllable variables mixed at different proportions to achieve \\nmarketing objectives at different situations. To  get maximum benefit these elements needs to \\nbe blended artfully in a simila r fashion as a chef does to the meal. Each element within the \\nmarketing mix can be controlled. A strategy for each element must be uniquely constructed \\nand blended with other elements to achieve an optimum marketing mix. Successful marketing \\nrequires careful tailoring to satisfy the target  market. In the client oriented marketing \\nphilosophy of the 1990s, the four Ps  can be translated into 4 Cs of marketing. This can be \\nrepresented in the following manner:can be represented in the following manner: \\n \\nProduct  \\n\"A product is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a need\" - (Kotler) \\nThis could include physical objects, services , persons, places, organisations and ideas.

For \\ndeveloping a product for the market one must ta ke into consideration the three levels of \\nthe products: \\ni) Core product- is the most basic level, which meets th e customer\\'s generic needs that must \\nbe met. \\nii) Tangible product- the core product made available to  the customers in some tangible ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\marketing.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='form. All tangible products will have the following five characteristics: \\n• Styling- distinctive look or feel \\n• Features- individual components added or subt racted without effecting the style \\nor quality of the product e.g. cars having additional features like tinted glass, \\nfog lights etc. Features are important from the competition point of view. \\n• Quality- perceived level of performance in a pr oduct or service. Organisations must \\nnot only set standards for quality but al so manage its quality  level over time. \\n• Packaging- the container or wrapper surrounding  the specific product or service. \\nGood and attractive packaging can add value beyond the perceived level of the \\nproduct. \\n• Branding -giving name, term, sign symbol or design or some combination to the \\nproduct or service of a seller to differentiate it from others in the market. \\niii) Augmented product- sellers offering over and above what customers expect or \\nare accustomed to. Additional service a nd benefits can be offered which go \\nbeyond the tangible products. \\nThus a product is a complex offering comprisi ng core need satisfying services, a set of \\ntangible characteristics and a set of augmented be nefits. Therefore, to have a competitive edge \\nin the market the company/organisation must examine its products and design them to carry \\nthe intended qualities to the intended target market. \\nOnce a new product or service is  introduced to the market, it enters the product life cycle. \\nThe product life cycle represen ts the pattern of sales for a product over time. This is \\nanalogous to a biological life cycle. Which achieves a level of  high acceptance at some point \\nand then there is decline at a later stage. Product life cycle is an excellent tool for planning and \\ndeveloping marketing strategies. The four stages  of product life cycle are: \\n• Introduction- At this stage there is slow grow th in the market requiring heavy \\nadvertising and promotion for aw areness building. Since the co st of promotion is high at \\nthis stage the price will be also on the higher side. \\n• Growth- In the second stage the sales start picking up new market segments are \\nexplored. Promotion activ ities continue with a shift of pr omotion of product category to \\nbrand advertising. At this stage the prices start falling and profits increase. \\n• Maturity- At this stage sales continue to increase but at a slower pace. Products reach a \\nsaturation point and more emph asis is given to servicing and repair. Product lines are \\nwidened to tap many market segments. Pric es and profits show a fall. Long product \\nusage and intensive promotion leads to brand loyalty. \\n• Decline- Permanent drop in sales heralds the decline stage. Rate of decline is governed \\nby factors like rapid changes in consumer tast es, changes in fashion, technical advances \\nleading to effective substitute s etc. At this stage either  the product may be totally \\nwithdrawn from the market or market rejuvenation tactics may be applied.

       " Document(page_content='The initial stage of any library/information servi ce is usually marked by slow growth in use, \\nheavy advertising and promotion. Staff must de velop the service to suit user needs. The \\ngrowth stage shows an increase in use of the se rvice that is still promoted quite heavily and \\nstaff may have to fine tune the service further to suit user needs. The maturity stage is \\ncharacterised by such services  being seen as standard, a slowdown in growth and the \\nspending of less time and money on a dvertising. In the last stage or the declining stage, fewer \\npeople use the service, it\" is often superseded by other more appropriate services, or gets low \\npriority and eventually plans are made to terminate it. \\nThe life cycle concept has some drawbacks too as  some stages cannot be clearly separated and \\nit may be difficult to dis tinguish into which stage of the life cycle the service falls. In case of \\nlibrary services, the maturity stage is dominant a nd most services fall into this category. It is \\nalso difficult to predict when the next stage of the life cycle will begin and how long it will \\nlast. Information technology is lik ely to have significant impact upon the life cycles of library \\nand information services in the future. As in formation technologies become more and more \\nadvanced and sophisticated, they will have the effect of shortening the life cycles of library \\nand information services as new and better ways will be found to deliver services or access \\ninformation thereby rendering the existing services  obsolete. The end result of this impact is \\nthat library and information service rnanagers will have to pay more attention to the product-\\nservice life cycle in the future. \\nProduct design consists of decisions relating to the kind of products or services the \\norganisation offers to a target community to sa tisfy existing needs or wants. Sources of new \\nproducts or service ideas can come from either staff or users. Libraries and information \\ncentres have a variety of produc ts/services to offer to their patrons.

Th is perceived value is \\ngenerally translated in terms of  money. `Valuation' or `perceiv ed value' is the simultaneous \\nappraisal by buyers and sellers of the econom ic and psychological worth of the market \\noffering. Prices are key to the revenue of an organisation. A price must be fixed which gives \\nan organisation a fair amount of profit on one ha nd and equals the perceived value to target \\ncustomers on the other. The price charged by a seller is the cost incurred by the buyer. \\nTo survive in today's highly competitive marketplace, organisations need pricing \\nobjectives that are specific, attainable and m easurable. Pricing goals can be divided into \\nthree categories: \\n• Profit oriented- this could be of three types: a) prof it maximisation where price is set at a \\nmuch higher level than the cost  of the item; b) satisfactory pr ofit with a reasonable level of \\nprofit; c) target return on investments. \\n• Sales oriented pricing- sales oriented pricing could be either to achieve a higher market \\nshare or to maximi se the unit sales. \\n• Status Quo pricing- to maintain a status quo or simply to meet the competition. \\nThe price established for a product depends primarily on demand for the good or service and \\nthe cost to the seller for that good or service.

The point  where the demand and \\nsupply curves intersect is called equilibrium. A price above equilibrium creates a surplus and \\na price below equilibrium results in loss. There are basically three types of pricing policy \\nfollowed: \\n• Cost based pricing: pricing mainly based on either tota l or marginal cost  of production. \\nCommon cost oriented pricing methods include- mark up pricing and cost plus pricing. In \\nboth the cases, price is dete rmined by adding fixed percentages to the unit cost of \\nproduction. \\n• Demand based pricing: the intensity of demand is taken into consideration for pricing \\npurposes. The levels of cost are not taken into account. Lower prices are charged where \\ndemand is weak and high er price where demand is intense. This method is known as price \\ndiscrimination. \\n• Competition based pricing: `going rate' or `imitative' pric ing are popular techniques of \\ncompetition oriented pricing. In this type of pricing, the price is not decided on either the \\ndemand or cost of production, but on the ongoing price in the market. This type of pricing is \\npopular because it represents the collective wi sdom of the industry concerning a price that \\nwould yield a fair return. Competition based pric ing is possible only in case of homogenous \\nproducts or services. \\nThere are three types of strategi es or techniques that can be a dopted for pricing any product or \\nservice. These are: \\nAverage cost pricing- in this method price of a product is selected to cover all the fixed and \\nvariable costs associated with the product. The objective is total cost recovery. The price is \\nset at such a level that it equals the average cost of  the product. The average cost pricing is \\nbased on the breakeven analysis. Breakeven analysis helps in determining the number of units \\nof a product to be sold to cove r the full costs. The point at which total revenue equals the total \\ncost is known as breakeven point. Any number of units sold beyond the breakeven point will \\nresult in profit and anything less than that will result in loss. Breakeven analysis helps in \\ndeciding the amount of a product to be sold at a proposed price in order to cover cost and \\nthen start making profit. \\n \", metadata={'source': 'files\\\\marketing.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\nFig. 17.3: Breakeven Analysis  \\nPrice discrimination- When a product is sold at two or more prices depending on the intensity \\nof demand it is known as price discrimination. For this the market must have different \\nsegments with different intens ity of demand. Price discrimi nation may be on the basis of \\ncustomers, product versions, place or time (peak load pricing). \\nMarginal cost pricing- Marginal cost is the change in the total cost of production for one more \\nunit. Marginal cost differs for every additional units produced. In marginal cost pricing the \\nprice is set equivalent to the ma rginal cost of production. Marginal cost is always lower than the \\naverage cost and hence the total cost of produc tion is not recovered in this process. This \\nmethod is appropriate from the welfare point of  view but not from th e profit point of view. \\nPricing techniques adopted by any organisa tion depends on their goals and objectives. \\nThe pricing objectives coul d be of several types: \\n• Cost recovery: A common pricing goal is to recover a portion of the production cost. In case \\nof services provided by the library and informa tion centres, the fixed costs may be paid by \\nthe government or the host institution and the operating costs or variable costs by the users \\nin the form of user fees. With  cost recovery as the goal, th e organisation must determine its \\ncost and the portions that are to be recovered. \\n• Market penetration: Market penetration or maximum partic ipation pricing is often used for \\nintroducing new products or serv ices in the market. Low prices are set to attract consumers to \\nenter the market. \\n• Market limitation: Once a new product gets established in the market, low prices may lead \\nto excess demand which may cr eate a disequilibrium situation. Thus in order to limit the \\nmarket, prices needs to be raised. \\n• Market equity: Market equity pricing seeks to price services according to the economic \\nnature of the goods i.e., public goods, private goods or merit goods. Pu blic goods should be \\nfunded through community taxes and not throu gh user charges. In case of merit goods the \\nbenefit accrue to the individuals but howeve r in the long run the whole community is \\nbenefited. In such cases pricing objective should  be to recover a portion of the cost. In the \\ncase of private goods the benefit flows directly to the individual s in the short run as well as \\nlong run and in such cases direct user charges would be more equitable.

In other words, one should know the \\ncompetitor's offerings and prices so that  one can compare the services with the \\ncompetitors. \\n• Knowledge of the market is  a must i.e., the knowledg e of new product in the \\nmarket, the potential users etc. \\n• Another question to be considered is whether or not a given product is a \\ncomplement or substitute for other products currently offered in th e market.

The nature of the \\npromotional mix depends on the following factors: \\n• Nature of the product- industrial or consumer product. \\n• Market conditions- needs, attitudes, likes and dislik es, strengths and weaknesses of \\nthe consumers and competitors in the market. \\n• Availability of funds- budget constraint may restrict promotional activities. \\n• Product life cycle- at the initial stages heavy investme nt will be required for promotional \\nactivities.

Lobbying should not be something that occurs once a year \\nwhen authorities are requested fo r more money but rather should be. a continuing programme \\nof formal and informal communication between the library and the authorities. \\nPlace \\nThe place element in the marketing mix is to ensure that products and services are available \\nto target customers in the `right place' and at  the `right time'. Place element has major impact \\non the levels of customer satisfaction. Place shoul d be designed to provide pre-planned levels \\nof customer service at the minimu m cost for each level of service. \\nThe most important marketing stra tegy available to any library is the place. If the information \\ncentre or the library is not conveniently located, users will decide that the services offered do \\nnot overcome the time and effort required in visiting the library.

A basic tenet underlying marketing strategy is that \\nthere are distinct market segment each with its own needs, wants desires and interests. \\nMarket segmentation is the division of mark et into distinctive gr oups of buyers who may \\nrequire different products or marketing mixes (Kotler et al, 1994). It is the division of market \\ninto homogenous groups, which will respond differe ntly to marketing mix variables i.e. the \\n4Ps of Product, Price, Promotion and Place. It is the division of a heterogeneous market into \\nhomogenous groups. Segmentation is important fr om the point of view of marketing as \\ndifferent buyers have different needs and want s. Each group or segment can be targeted by \\nusing different marketing mix to reach poten tial buyers with most customized offering \\npossible. Very often, librarians  build up their collection by pr esuming the needs and want of \\nthe users without taking into account the interests of us er groups. Library market \\nsegmentation takes into account th e fact that library users who request a product or a service \\nare all individuals who are unique in some way. Market segmentation is useful for the \\nfollowing reasons: \\nEasier marketing- it is easy to address the ne eds of small groups of buyer especially if they \\nhave many common characteristics. \\nFind niches- less contested buyers can be targeted for newly launched products. \\nEfficient- marketing resources can be focused to best segments that are receptive to the \\nofferings of product, price pr omotion and place and hence avoi d wastage of time and funds \\nto uninterested party. \\nMarket segmentation can be adopted when there are significant, measurable differences in the \\nmarket.

The librarians  of public libraries sh ould usually look out for \\ngeographic locations requiring library services  and serve them accordingly. Rural areas which \\nare remote and isolated can be best served by mobile library services. Special libraries serving \\nindustries and R&D organisations having branches in located in differen t regions will have to \\nconsider specific needs of each location and develop services accordingly. \\nDemographic segmentation- In this case the market is divided on the basis of demographic \\nvariables like age, sex, occupa tion, income, race etc. Demogra phic Market segmentation is one \\nof the most popular meth ods of distinguishing market segmen ts in libraries. They are often \\nassociated with clear market needs, and info rmation relating to thes e markets is readily \\navailable. Demographic mark ets may be identified by ag e, sex, nationality, income, \\noccupation, religion, social needs (like hobbies, s ports, some form of entertainment, etc.) and \\nphysical needs (for physically handicapped). \\nPsychographic segmentation- Dividing the buyers on the basis of socioeconomic status, \\nlifestyle, hobbies or pers onality traits is psychographic se gmentation. This type of market \\nexamines attitudes, living styles, personality and social classes, people who have a past history \\nof using libraries have to be reminded of libra ry services and their use. Also, people with \\nchanged life styles, with new environments, with  new facilities could be encouraged to make \\nuse of library services. \\nBehavioural segmentation- Buyers are divided on the basis of their product knowledge, \\nusage, brand loyalty, attitude, response to marketing factors etc. \\nDescriptor variables are used to describe each segment and distinguish one segment from \\nthe other. Descriptor variables must be easily  available measures or it must be linkable \\nto easily obtainable measures that  exist in secondary sources. \\nThe strength of market segmentation lies in the fact that it is based upon the end user \\nrather than on product or service. The end user  is assured of a service which satisfies as \\nfar as possible, his or her individual needs rather than a mass market general offering. \\n17.7.1: Strategies for Market Segmentation \\nWe already know that market targeting involves the evaluation, selection and concentration \\non those market segments which the library  has decided to serve. Library market \\nsegmentation takes into account the fact that a ll the library users who request a product or \\nservice are individuals who are unique in some way. Therefor e, it is essential that libraries \\nidentify those parts of the mass market whic h they can most effect ively serve. Bryson \\nsuggests three strategies for doing this: \\n• Undifferentiated Marketing  \\n• Differentiated Marketing  \\n• Concentrated Marketing \\n ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\marketing.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"a) Undifferentiated Marketing\\nUndifferentiated marketing is that where all people have similar or identical needs and \\nthe organisation goes after the whole market with single offering. All users are treated \\nsimilarly, everyone offered a standard product and every eligible person is made to use \\nits products (books, journals, databases, bib liographies, etc.) and services (reference, \\nonline, lending, interlib rary loan, etc,). In other word s, those services  are provided \\nwhich appeal to the broadest  number of users. In concen trating on these services the \\nlibrary attempts to achieve excellence. Undi fferentiated marketing is usually applied \\nwhen there are financial constr aints and special services are to be curtailed. This helps \\nin saving costs. It is also applicable in situations where the whole society is the target \\nmarket. \\nb) Differentiated Marketing\\nIn differentiated marketing a library decide s to divide the mass market into smaller \\ngroups or segments and designs separate  services and programmes for each. This \\napproach recognises the different needs of users and provides criteria for examining the \\npotential users. When the entire populati on is divided into groups, the librarian can \\nnotice the user groups whose needs are not being met Then each individual group's special needs can be examined and identified and plans can be made to influence such \\nuser groups to use the library's resources. \\nHowever, there are costs associated with this approach as these special services involve additional staff, administrative and promotional costs. \\nc) Concentrated Marketing\\nConcentrated marketing refers to a situati on when the library or information centre \\nconcentrates upon a small number of users or specific areas of services. In this case, \\ninstead of treating all users similarly, the library or information centre provides in-depth services in a few areas or serving a smal l percentage of the users. The library \\npurposefully determines a small number of targ et market and sets out  actively to serve \\nthose areas only. Through its concentration in particular group or area of service the \\nlibrary or information centre achieves a st rong market position because of its greater \\nknowledge of its market segments' needs and its subsequent reputation through \\nconcentrated service. For instance special lib rary or information centre may decide to \\nconcentrate upon a selective dissemination of in formation service. This will help them \\nin providing customized service as per the requirement of users and fulfill their information requirements. \\n \\n17.8 : Market Research/Analysis\\nMarket research or market an alysis provides the organisation with information necessary to \\nanalyse decisions regarding the specific stru cture of the marketing programme.

       " Document(page_content=\"There are various analyses which aid market strategies. These are exchange system \\nanalysis, image analysis, c onsumer satisfaction studies, product life cycle and product \\nportfolio matrix. \\nExchange System Analysis  \\nThis enables the library/information centre manager to identify what the users are prepared to \\nexchange for the services which the library of fers. Its importance lies in the fact that both \\ntangible and intangible items can be identified, thus allowing the important values which the \\nlibrary community holds to be identified. This  provides useful information for planning new \\nservices or justifying existing services. \\nImage Analysis  \\nImage analysis is very important in determining the library's or information centre's image to \\nboth the funding and governing bodies and to its  users. They are important because they \\ndetermine what people respond to. All organisati ons need a positive image in order to attract \\nfunds and users.

Market being saturated, the growth may get stabilized. \\nIf growth is to continue, the li brary/ information centre will have  to introduce new services or \\nseek new markets. Bryson suggests the following options for libraries/ information centres in \\nsuch situations: \\n• remain in same situation and accept the results, as it is \\n• to look for new markets \\n• to diversify into new areas \\n• to provide new services to existing markets \\nChanges in user behaviour, competitor be haviour, technological developments and \\ngovernment policies may also infl uence the organisation to adopt  one of the above mentioned \\noptions. For library/information services, rejuve nation strategies may be adopted to recover \\nsome of the services lack of use over time. Libraries and information centres can overcome \\nthe decline in the product life cycle by ap plying recapturing strate gies, redesigning the \\nservices, refocusing or recasting them. \\nRecapturing Strategies\\nWhen the service or product is in the decline stage of the lifecycle recapturing strategies need \\nto be adopted to revive the old market. In this strategy the tactic is to concentrate on previous \\nand existing users without modifying the se rvice. User sensitisation programmes through \\ndisplays in libraries or personal contact with users which promote existing services are some \\nexamples of recapturing strategies. \\nRedesigning Strategies\\nThis involves marketing a modified version of  the library service or product, which have \\nbeen declining or have been abandoned earli er. As users needs and wants keeps on changing, \\nthe original reasons for rejection of a product or service may not pr evail any longer. By \\nredesigning the products and services it may be possible to revive interest among present \\nusers.

An example for this may be \\nmarketing a newspaper clipping service starte d through demand for some important user or \\ndirector of an organisation. Such a strategy may result in greater usage of the service by other \\nusers. \\nThe library's decision to re juvenate its services will however depend on its resource \\nrequirements and capabilities.

MARKETING STRATEGIES Olivier Furrer, Radboud University Nijmegen (The Netherlands )  INTRODUCTION The study and practice of marketing have broadened considerably, from an emphasis on marketing as a functional management issue, to a wider focus on the strategic role of marketing in overall corporate strategy (e.g., Kotler, 2000;  Sudha rshan, 1995) . This broadening of the marketing concept, to include strategic as well as operational decisions, has resulted in an overlap between marketing and strategic management. Managers around the globe are recognizing the increasing importance for the firm to develop marketing strategies to compete effectively in worldwide markets. The emergence of a more open world econom y, the globalization of consumers’ tastes, and the development of a worldwide commercial web all have increased the interdependency and interconne ctions of markets across the globe. In such a global environment, firms should develop their marketing strategy around three key-dimensions (Zou and Cavusgil, 2002): (1) standardization-adaptation, (2) configuration-coordination, and (3) strategic integration. Following Sudha rshan (1995) , we define a firm’s marketing strategy as the development of and decisions about a firm’s relationships with its key stakeholders, its offerings, resource allocation, and timing. The first, and perhaps the most important dimension of a multinational corporation1 (MNC)’s worldwide marketing strategy is related to the standardization or adaptation of marketing programs, such as produc t offering, promotional mix, price, and channel structure, across different countries (Jain, 1989;  Keegan, 2000;  Laroche et al., 2001;  Levitt, 1983 ; Ohmae, 1989;  Samiee and Roth, 1992;  Szymanski, Bharadwaj and Varadarajan, 1993;  Yip, 2003;  Zou and Cavusgil, 1996) . The second dimension of a worldwide marketing strategy focuses on configuration and coordination of a firm’s value chain activities across countries (Craig and Douglas, 2000;  Hout, Porter and Rudde n, 1982;  Porter, 1986 , 1990;  Roth, Schweiger and Morrison, 1991) . Finally, the third dimension is the strategic integration dimension, which is concerned with how a MNC’s competitive battles are planned and executed across country                                                 1 Multinational corporations or MNCs are defined, following Dunning (1992) as firms that own and control value-adding activities in more than one country.

       " Document(page_content='2. markets (Birkinshaw, Morrison and Hulland, 1995; Yip, 1989,  2003;  Zou and Cavusgil, 1996) . In this chapter, we focus our attention on these three worldwide marketing strategy dimensions and how they are combined by MNCs from different regions of the world to gain a competitive advantage. A dominant conceptualization for examining the configuration of these three dimensions within worldwide marketing strategies is the integration-respons iveness framework (e.g., Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Furrer, Sudha rshan and Thomas, 2001;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998;  Harzing, 2000;  Jarillo and Martinez, 1990;  Johns on, 1995;  Perlmutter, 1969;  Prahalad and Doz, 1987;  Roth, 1992;  Roth and Morrison, 1990;  Taggart, 1997) . This framework sugge sts that two salient imperatives simultaneously confront a business competing internationally. A MNC, to secure competitive advantages vis-à-vis the domestic firm, must exploit market imperfections that are derived through multi-country capacities. However, given that the MNC is operating in several countries, it must also be responsive to the demands imposed by local gove rnmental and market forces in each country. A worldwide strategy is framed by the respons e to or management of these two imperatives: meeting local demands and capitalizing on worldwide competitive advantages. The framework, therefore, suggests that MNCs develop strategies across two dimensions: The first dimension, integration, refers to the standardization, coordination, and integration of activities across countries in an attempt to build efficient operations networks and take maximum advantage of similarities across locations. The second dimension, respons iveness, refers to the attempt to respond to specific needs within a variety of host countries. Within this framework, Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998)  have identified four generic worldwide strategies: (1) an international strategy2 which is a strategy in which strategic and operational decisions are developed in the home and only subsequently transferred abroad to be adapted to the local market; (2) a multinational (or multidomestic) strategy which is a strategy in which strategic and operational decisions are decentralized to the strategic business unit in each country so as to allow that unit to adapt produc ts to the local market; (3) a global strategy which is a strategy through which a firm offers standardized produc ts across country markets with                                                 2  It should be noted that the terms international, multinational, global, and transnational have been used very differently and sometimes interchangeably by various authors (e.g., Levitt, 1983; Porter, 1986, 1990; Yip, 2003). In this chapter, following Ghoshal and Bartlett (1998), we give each term a specific and different meaning. ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

More recently, MNCs from all regions started to change their strategy to adopt a more effective, but more complex, transnational strategy. In the reminder of this chapter, we first describe and further develop the four worldwide generic strategies. Then, we explore the consequences of adopting one of these strategies for three critical marketing operational strategies: (1) marketing decision-making processes; (2) innova tion and new produc t development; and (3) service quality strategies. Because of their diversity and their particularities these three marketing operational strategies provide a wide range of experiences.

MARKETING STRATEGY DIMENSIONS The three key-dimensions of an MNC’s worldwide marketing strategy, as previously mentioned, are: (1) standardization-adaptation, (2) configuration-coordination, and (3) strategic integration (Zou and Cavusgil, 2002) . Standar dization/Adaptation refers to the use of basically the same (standardization) or different (adaptation) produc t or service, advertising, distribution channels, and other elements of the marketing mix across countries (e.g., Kotler, 2000;  Levitt, 1983;  Bharadwaj and Varadarajan, 1993;  Zou and Cavusgil, 2002) . MNCs following a standardization strategy believe that world markets are being homogenized by advances in communication and transportation technology (Jain, 1989;  Levitt, 1983). Increasingly, customers in distant part of the world tend to exhibit similar preferences and demand the same produc ts and services (Jain, 1989;  Ohmae, 1985) . Therefore, a major source of competitive advantage in worldwide markets is the ability to produc e high-quality, low-price produc ts (Levitt, 1983 ). To attain a low-cost position, the optimum worldwide marketing strategy is to sell standardized produc ts and services using standardized marketing programs (Porter, 1986,  1990) . For the MNCs following this strategy, major benefits of standardization include econom ies of scale in produc tion and marketing (Levitt, 1983) , consistency in dealing with customers across countries (Laroche et al., 2001;  Zou, Andrus and Norvell, 1997) , and the ability to exploit good idea on a worldwide scale (Buzzell, 1968;  Ohmae, 1989;  Quelch and Hoff, 1986) . Although the standardization approach has numerous advantages, its unconditional adoption has some severe drawbacks (Bodde wyn, Soehl and Picard, 1986;  Douglas and Wind, 1987 ), one of which is its cultural insensitivity (Usunier, 2000) . Consumers in different countries have widely varied cultural backgrounds , needs and wants, spending power, produc t preferences and shoppi ng patterns. Because these differences may be hard to change, some MNCs prefer to adapt their marketing programs to closely fit consumer desires and expectations in each country (Kotler, 2000) . Configuration is the way in which an MNC configures its upstream, downstream and internal value-adding activities. A firm may choos e to concentrate its activities in one country and to export and market its produc ts and services in a range of foreign countries. Alternatively, a firm may decide to disperse its value-adding activities to several countries. In both cases, the advantages of alternative locations for each activity will influence the architecture of value chain activities which is finally selected (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Porter, 1985) . There are two broad directions of configuration of value-adding activities: ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5. concentration or dispersal. In some indus tries there are advantages to be obtained from concentrating activities in a small number of countries and exporting to foreign markets. This is true when locational factors are important and regional advantages may be gained (Dunning, 1992 , 1998 ; Porter, 1990) . Competitive advantage may also arise from dispersing activities in several countries. Dispersed activities involve foreign direct investment. It is best to disperse activities when: (1) transportation, communication, or storage costs are high; (2) factors like exchange rates and political risk are important; (3) national markets differ because of culture; and (4) gove rnments exert influence via tariffs, subsidies and nationalistic purchasing (gove rnments tend to favor location of whole value chain in their country) (Dunning, 1992,  1998;  Porter, 1990) . In addition to adopting the optimum configuration, competitive edge can be gained by efficient and effective coordination of diverse activities, which could be located in a number of different countries. Coordination involves sharing information, allocating respons ibility, and aligning efforts (Porter, 1990) . It is differing linguistic, cultural, political, legal, technological and econom ic factors, coupled to geography and distance, which pose the problems that require worldwide coordination. Strategic Integration is concerned with how an MNC’s competitive battles are planned and executed across country markets (Jayachandran, Gimeno and Varadarajan, 1999;  Zou and Cavusgil, 2002) . A key to worldwide marketing strategy success is participation in all major world markets to gain competitive leverage and effective integration of the firm’s competitive campaigns across these markets (Birkinshaw, Morrison and Hulland, 1995;  Yip, 1989,  2003;  Zou and Cavusgil, 1996,  2002) . MNCs may manage their markets and operations in different countries independently or interdependently. Some MNCs fight their competitors one country at a time in separate contests, even though it may face another MNC in many of the same countries (Yip, 2003) . However, when markets and operations are perceived as interdependent, an MNC could subsidize operations in some markets with resources generated in others (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Birkinshaw, Morrison, and Hulland, 1995 ; Hamel and Prahalad, 1985)  and respond to competitive attacks in one market by counterattacking in others (Jayachandran, Gimeno and Varadarajan, 1999;  Yip, 1989,  2003) . It is therefore important to integrate the firm’s competitive moves across the major markets in the world (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004; Birkinshaw, Morrison, and Hulland, 1995;  Zou and Cavusgil, 2002) . The same type of move may be made in different countries at the same time or in some systematic sequence (Douglas and Craig, 1989) , or a competitor may be attacked in one country in order to drain its resources for another country, or a ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='6. competitive attack in one country could be countered in a different country (Jayachandran, Gimeno and Varadarajan, 1999) . Perhaps, the best example is the counterattack in a competitor’s market as a parry to an attack on one’s own home market (Yip, 2004) . MNCs’ ADMINISTRATIVE AND CULTURAL HERITAGE A firm’s worldwide strategy is shaped not only by its current external environment but also by its past internal management biases. In particular, MNCs are influenced by the path by which they developed and the values, norms, and practices of their management. Firms are, to a significant extent, captives of their past (i.e., their administrative and cultural heritage) (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . MNCs as any organizations are symbolic entities; they function according to implicit models in the minds of their members, and these models are culturally determined (Hofstede, 2001) . There is strong evidence that culture plays an important and enduring role in shaping the assumptions, beliefs, and values of individuals (Hofstede, 1980b , 1991,  2001;  Hall, 1976 , 1983;  Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner, 1998 ; Usunier, 2000)  (cf. box 1).  Box 1: Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions Perhaps the most celebrated effort to date to describe and categorize these differences in the orientations and values of people in different countries is Hofstede’s (1980b, 1991, 2001; Bond et al., 1987) study (Questionnaire data from 116,000 IBM employees in 72 countries across seven occupations.) that described national cultural differences along five key dimensions: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Masculinity (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAV), and Long-Term Orientation (LTO). Power Distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. The basic problem involved is the degree of human inequality that underlies the functioning of each particular society. Individualism on the one side versus its opposite collectivism is the degree to which individuals are supposed to look after themselves or remain integrated into groups, usually around the family. Positioning itself between these poles is a very basic problem all societies face. Masculinity versus its opposite, femininity, refers to the distribution of emotional roles between genders, which is another fundamental problem for any society to which a range of solutions are found; it oppose “tough” masculine to “tender” feminine societies. Uncertainty Avoidance is the extent to which a culture programs its members to feel either uncomfortable or comfortable in unstructured situations. Unstructured situations are novel, unknown, surprising, different from usual. The basic problem involved is the degree to which a society tries to control the uncontrollable. Long-Term versus Short-Term Orientation refers to the extent to which a culture programs its members to accept delayed gratification of their material, social, and emotional needs. Cultures with a long-term orientation exhibit a pragmatic future-oriented perspective (fostering virtues like perseverance and thrift), rather than a conventional historic or short-term point of view.

FOUR GENERIC WORLDWIDE STRATEGIES Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998)  have identified four generic worldwide strategies: (1) an international strategy; (2) a multinational strategy; (3) a global strategy; and finally (4) a transnational strategy. International Strategy In the earliest stages of a firm’s internationalization, managers tend to think of the overseas operations as some kind of distant outposts whose main role is to suppor t the domestic parent company in different ways such as contributing incremental sales of the domestic produc t, or supplying raw materials or compone nts to the domestic manufacturing operations. Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998)  have labeled this generic strategy, international strategy. The international terminology derives directly from Vernon (1966 )’s international product cycle theory (cf. box 2), which states that produc ts are first developed for a firm’s domestic market, and only subsequently sold abroad. This strategy is primarily based on transferring and adapting the parent company’s know ledge or capabilities to foreign markets. The parent retains considerable influence and control over the foreign subsidiaries, but less than with the global strategy (see below) and the foreign subsidiaries can adapt to the needs and preferences of their local markets produc ts and ideas ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Box 2: Vernon’s International Product Cycle Theory This theory suggests that the starting point for the internationalization process is typically an innovation that a firm creates in its home country. In the first phase of exploiting the innovation, the firm will build production facilities in its home market not only because this is where its main customer base is located, but also because of the need to maintain close linkages between research and production in this phase of the development cycle. In this early stage, some demand may also be created in other countries where consumer needs and market development are similar to the home country. These requirements would normally be met out of home production, thereby generating exports for the firm. As the product matures and production processes become standardized, the firm enters a new stage. By this time, demand in the foreign countries may have become quite sizable and export sales, from being a marginal side benefit, are now an important part of the revenues from the new business. Furthermore, competitors will probably begin to see the growing demand for the new product as a potential opportunity to establish themselves in markets served by exports. To prevent or counteract such competition and also to meet the foreign demand more effectively, the innovating firm typically sets up production facilities in the importing countries, thereby making the transition from being an exporter to becoming a true MNC. Finally, in the third stage, the product becomes highly standardized and many competitors enter the business. Competition now focuses on price and, therefore, on cost. This activates a resource-seeking motive, and the firm moves production to low-wage developing countries, both to meet local demand that has by now sprung up in these countries, and also to meet the demands of its customers in the developed markets at a lower cost. (Source: Vernon, 1966)  Traditionally, a firm following an international strategy can choos e between one of three basic marketing adaptation options (Keegan, 2000) : (1) produc t standardization-communication adaptation, (2) produc t adaptation-communication standardization, or (3) produc t adaptation-communication adaptation. The first option, produc t standardization-communication adaptation, is often chosen when reasons for buying a produc t differ from country to country, but the usage conditions and standards remain identical. In this case, the same produc t can be marketed but with a change in the communications strategy. This strategy is quite cost-effective, because communications adaptation is less expensive than tailoring a produc t to the local market. The second option, produc t adaptation-communication standardization, is appropriate when the phys ical event surroundi ng produc t usage varies but the sociocultural event is the same as in the firm’s home country. Kotler (2000)  mentions the example of Kraft that blends different coffees for the British (who drink their coffee with milk), the French (who drink their coffee black), and Latin Americans (who want a chicory taste). Finally, the third option of dual adaptation of produc t and communication is generally favored for a produc t when both usage conditions and sociocultural concerns vary among markets.

       " Document(page_content='9. Many U.S. MNCs, such as Kraft, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, and General Electric, enjoyed their fastest international expansion in the 1950s  and 1960s  (cf. Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . At that time, their main strength laid in the new technologies and management processes they had developed as a consequence of being located in the world’s largest, richest, and most technologically advanced market. After the war, their foreign expansion focused primarily on leveraging this strength. The management approach in most these U.S. firms was built on a willingne ss to delegate respons ibility, while retaining overall control through  sophisticated management systems and specialist corporate staffs (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998;  Taggart, 1997) . Foreign subsidiaries were often free to adapt produc ts or marketing strategies to reflect local differences, but their dependence on the parent company for new produc ts, processes, and ideas dictated a great deal of coordination and control by headqua rters. The main handicap such companies faced was that parent-company management often adopted a parochial and even superior attitude toward international operations, perhaps because of the assumption that new ideas and developments all came from the parent. Nonetheless, the approach was highly successful in the postwar decades. While these companies built considerable strengths out of their ability to create and leverage innova tions and marketing know ledge, many suffered from deficiencies of both efficiency and flexibility since they did not develop either centralized and high-scale operations, or a very high degree of local respons iveness. Even until recently, it is not infrequent for a U.S. firm to start its internationalization process with an international strategy (cf. box 3)   Box 3: McDonald’s in India The McDonald’s formula, hugely successful as it is, was always going to have to be adapted to a place such as India where killing cows is sacrilege. But burger joints are not the only ones that need to be careful, Western firms tempted by India’s growing middle class, have to be sensitive to the country’s definite tastes. McDonald’s, which now has 56 restaurants in India, was launched there in 1996. It has had to deal with a market that is 40% vegetarian, with the aversion to either beef or pork among meat-eaters, with hostility to frozen meat and fish, and with the general Indian fondness for spice with everything. To satisfy such tastes, McDonald’s has discovered that it needs to do more than provide the right burgers. Customers buying vegetarian burgers want to be sure that these are cooked in a separate area in the kitchen using separate utensils. Sauces like McMasala and McImli are on offer to satisfy the Indian taste for spice. McDonald’s promises to introduce a spiced version of its fries soon. Although its expansion has been faster in India than some other Asian countries such as Indonesia, it has hardly been rapid. Yet, at least, the firm has avoided the disasters of some other big American names. In the mid 90s’, violent protests in Bangalore in southern India over the quality of its food temporarily closed KFC which sells fried chicken. In 1995, Kellogg made a splash pitching breakfast cereals as a healthier alternative to the heavy Indian breakfast. Indians were unimpressed. Kellogg facing mounting losses is now selling to a westernized niche market instead. Most of U.S. companies have got three things wrong in India with their international strategy. They overestimated the size and disposable income of the much-touted Indian middle class. They ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='10. underestimated the strength of local products in the markets they were entering and they overestimated the value of their reputation. Indian consumers seem unimpressed by the glamour of the western brands, food companies are scaling down their plans accordingly (Source: The Economist, 1997)  Multinational Strategy A multinational strategy is adopted when managers recognize and emphasize the differences among national markets and operating environments. Forces for localization include culture-driven differences in national tastes and preferences; gove rnment policies that demand high levels of local content; technological developments such as flexible manufacturing that have dramatically reduced the minimum efficient scale of produc tion for some products; and the greater role of maintenance, financing and other services as tools of competition as customers become more demanding. The multinational strategic approach focuses primarily on national differences to achieve most of its strategic objectives. Firms following a multinational strategy adopt a more flexible approach to their international operations by modifying their produc ts and marketing strategies country by country in respons e to national differences in customer preferences, indus try characteristics, and gove rnment regulations. Many European companies such as Unilever, ICI, Philips, and Nestlé have traditionally followed this strategic model (c.f. Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998 ). In these companies, assets and resources historically were widely dispersed, allowing overseas subsidiaries to carry out a wide range of activities from development and produc tion to sales and services. Their self-sufficiency was typically accompanied by considerable local autonom y (Jarillo and Martinez, 1990;  Taggart, 1997). But, while such independent national units were unus ually flexible and respons ive to their local environments, they inevitably suffered problems of inefficiencies and an inability to exploit the know ledge and competencies of other national units. The emerging configuration of distributed assets and delegated respons ibility fit well with the ingrained management norms and practices in many European companies (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . Because of the important role of owners and bankers in corporate-level decision-making, European companies, particularly those from the United Kingdom , the Netherlands, and France, developed an internal culture that emphasized personal relationships rather than formal structures, and financial controls more than coordination of technical or operational detail. This management style, philosophy,  and capability tended to reinforce companies’ willingne ss to delegate more operating independence and strategic freedom to ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='11. their foreign subsidiaries. Highly autonom ous national companies were often managed more as a portfolio of offshore investments rather than as a single international business. Global Strategy While a multinational strategy typically results in very respons ive marketing approaches in the different national markets, it also gives rise to an inefficient manufacturing infrastructure within the company (Levitt, 1983) . Local produc tion plants are often built more to provide local marketing advantages or to improve political relations than to maximize produc tion efficiency (Dunning, 1992) . Similarly, the proliferation of produc ts designed to meet local needs also contributes to a general loss of efficiency in design, produc tion, logistics, distribution, and other marketing tasks. In an operating environment of improving transportation and communication infrastructures and falling trade barriers, some MNCs adopted a very different strategic approach in their international operations. These firms, many of them of Japanese origin, think in terms of creating produc ts for a world market and marketing them on global scale, often at the corporate center. They try to gain a competitive advantage through building global efficiencies through econom ies of scale and econom ies of scope (Chandler, 1990) . Scale efficiency is used as a competitive tool primarily because it has the potential to yield reduction in produc tion costs by spreading the fixed costs over a higher volume of output. Further cost reduction from scale arises from the learning curve effect (Lieberman, 1984;  Pattison and Teplitz, 1989 ). This is because as produc tion volume increases, the employees involved in the produc tion process accumulate experience and learning, which result in steady reduction in costs as the firm moves down its learning curve. Global efficiencies are influenced not only by the scale econom ies of its various activities, but also by the presence of cost saving across functions or units. Econom ies of scope exit when “it is less costly to combine two or more produc ts lines in one firm than to produc e them separately” (Panzar and Willig, 1981,  p. 268). The strategic importance of scope econom ies arises from a diversified MNC’s ability to share investments and costs across the same or different value chains. Such sharing can take place across segments, products, or markets. Sony is an example of a firm that has captured scope econom ies through the exploitation of a single brand name across diverse markets and Matsushita have benefited considerably from its ability to market a wide range of produc ts (radios, TVs, tape recorders, VCRs) through the same distribution channel. Another important compone nt of scope econom ies is shared know ledge. NEC, for example, is ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='12. seeking global efficiency through the combination of its competencies in computer and communication technologies. Globally standardized produc ts can increase competitive leverage by providing low-cost produc ts that can be the basis for invading markets (Yip, 2003) . When they first entered world markets, most Japanese firms lacked the resources to develop and suppor t different produc ts for different countries. Turning this weakness into a strength, they focused on a small number of globally standardized produc ts that initially via low cost, then via superior quality, allowed them to conque r market after market (Yip, 2003 ). This strategy is defined as a global strategy because it views the world as its unit of analysis. The unde rlying assumption is that national tastes and preferences are more similar than different, or that they can be made similar by providing customers with standardized produc ts with adequate cost and quality advantages over those national varieties that they have been used to (Jain, 1989;  Levitt, 1983;  Ohmae, 1989;  Samiee and Roth, 1992) . This strategic approach requires considerably more central coordination and control than the others. In such companies, research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities are typically managed from the headqua rters, and most strategic decisions are also taken at the center. For firms adopting a global strategy, a competitive advantage depends primarily on the search for global efficiency. Such MNCs use all the different means to achieve the best cost and quality positions for their produc ts and services (i.e., Johns on, 1995;  Roth and Morrison, 1990) . This has been the typical approach of many Japanese companies such as Toyota, Canon, Komatsu, and Matsushita (cf. Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . Such a global strategy, with its focus on cost control, requires a tight central control of produc t development, procurement, manufacturing, and marketing. Such an approach fit the cultural background and organizational values in many Japanese MNCs. At the founda tion of the internal processes were the strong national cultural norms that emphasized group behavior and valued interpersonal harmony. By keeping primary decision-making and control at the center, Japanese companies could retain their culturally dependent management system that is communications-intensive and people-dependent.  Alternative Global Strategies Porter (1990) developed a model global strategy based upon the generic strategy framework (Porter, 1980, 1985). He argued that the generic cost leadership or differentiation strategies can be operated on a global scale as either global cost leadership or global differentiation, targeting either an entire global market or a particular global segment. In other words, the scope of the strategy can be either broad or ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='13. narrow but on a global scale. Each of these archetypical strategies represents a fundamentally different conception of how to compete. In shipbuilding, for example, Japanese firms follow the differentiation strategy, offering a wide array of high-quality vessels at premium prices. Korean shipyards pursue the cost leadership strategy, also offering many types of vessels at lower cost that can Japanese firms. Successful Scandinavian yards are focused differentiators, concentrating on specialized types of ships such as icebreakers and cruise ships that involve specialized technology and which commend prices high enough to offset higher Scandinavian labor costs. Finally, Chinese shipyards (cost focus), the emerging competitors in the industry, offer relatively simple, standard vessel types at even lower costs (and prices) than the Koreans (Porter, 1990, p. 39).  As several companies have found,  however, such efficiency comes with some compromise of both flexibility and learning. For example, concentrating manufacturing to capture global scale may also result in a high level of inter-country produc t shipments that can raise risks of policy intervention, particularly by host gove rnments in major importer countries. Similarly, companies that centralize R&D for efficiency reasons often find they are constrained in their ability to capture new developments in countries outside their home markets or to leverage innova tions created by foreign subsidiaries in the rest of their worldwide operations (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998 ). Transnational Strategy Throughout  the 1970s  and 80s, many of the firms pursuing a global strategy were very successful (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . In a rapidly globalizing environment, they dominated, not only local companies, but international and multinational competitors as well. Their very success, however, created and strengthened a set of countervailing forces of localization. Customers contributed to the strengthening of the localizing forces by rejecting homogenized global produc ts and reasserting their national preferences, albeit without relaxing their expectation of high-quality and low costs that global produc ts had offered (Holt, Quelch and Taylor, 2004;  Quelch, 2003) . As a result, many global firms recognized that the demands to be respons ive to local market and the pressures to develop global-scale competitive efficiency were simultaneous (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998;  Holt, Quelch and Taylor, 2004)  (cf. box 4). Under these conditions, the either/or attitude reflected in both the multinational and the global strategic strategies were increasingly inappropriate. The emerging requirement was for companies to become more respons ive to local needs while retaining their global efficiency, an emerging approach to worldwide management that Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998)  call the transnational strategy.

       " Document(page_content='14.  Box 4: Global Brands “Although Levitt (1983) did not explicitly discuss branding, managers interpreted his ideas to mean that [MNCs] should standardize products, packaging, and communication to achieve a least-common-denominator positioning that would be effective across cultures. From that commonsense standpoint, global branding was only about saving costs and ensuring consistent customer communication. The idea proved to be popular in the 198s, when several countries opened up to foreign competition and American and Japanese corporations tried to penetrate those markets with global brands and marketing programs. While the world economy continued to integrate, experiments with global branding soon slowed. Consumers in most countries had trouble relating to the generic products and communications that resulted from companies’ least-common-denominator thinking. Executives therefore rushed to fashion hybrid strategies. They strove for global scale on backstage activities such as technology, production, and organization but made sure product features, communications, distribution, and selling techniques were customized to local consumer tastes. Such “glocal” strategies have rule marketing ever since” Holt, Quelch and Taylor, 2004, p. 68.  In such firms, key activities and resources are neither centralized in the parent company, nor decentralized so that each subsidiary can carry out its own tasks on a local-for-local basis. Instead, the resources and activities are dispersed but specialized, so as to achieve efficiency and flexibility at the same time. Furthermore, these dispersed resources are integrated into an interdependent network of worldwide operations. In contrast to the global model, the transnational strategy recognizes the importance of flexible and respons ive country-level operations (Jarillo and Martinez, 1990;  Taggart, 1997) . Compared to the multinational strategy, the transnational strategy provides mechanisms for linking and coordinating foreign subsidiaries’ operations to retain competitive effectiveness and econom ic efficiency.  Customizing Global Marketing According to Quelch and Hoff (1986), how far a company can move toward global marketing depends a lot on its evolution and traditions (i.e., its administrative and cultural heritage). To support their argument, the provide two examples: (1) Although the Coca-Cola Company had conducted some international business before 1940, it gained true global recognition during World War II, as Coke bottling plants followed the march of U.S. troops around the world. Management in Atlanta made all strategic decisions then, and still does now. The brand name, concentrate formula, positioning, and advertising theme are virtually standard worldwide, but the artificial sweetener and packaging differ across countries. Local managers are responsible for sales and distribution programs, which they run in conjunction with local bottlers. (2) The Nestlé approach also has its roots in history. To avoid distribution disruptions caused by wars in Europe, to ease rapid worldwide expansion, and to respond to local consumer needs, Nestlé granted its local managers considerable autonomy from the outset. While the local managers still retain much of that decision-making power today, Nestlé headquarters in Vevey has grown in importance. Nestlé has transferred to its central marketing staff many former local managers who had succeeded in their Nestlé businesses and who now influence country executive to accept standard new product and marketing ideas. The trend seems to be toward tighter marketing coordination.  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='15. Conclusion In terms of marketing strategy, George Yip’s (2003)  view is that a worldwide marketing strategy must be part of a worldwide business strategy. A global strategy will be appropriate when customer needs are globally common, when there are global customers and channels, and when marketing is globally transferable. In addition, cost drivers are likely to favor a global approach to marketing by creating economies of scale and scope. There are also competitive advantages of global marketing, through,  for example, global branding. Yip did not advoc ate a marketing strategy which is global in every detail, rather one which is global where there are evident advantages and local where necessary: So global marketing is not a blind adherence to standardization of all marketing elements for its own sake, but a different, global approach to developing marketing strategy and programs that blends flexibility with uniformity (Yip 2003 ). In essence, then, a transnational marketing strategy is concerned with devising a strategy which is global in scope and which is globally coordinated. The extent of globalization of each element of the strategy will be dependent upon the organization’s transnational strategy and the relative advantages of globalization or localization based on factors such as customers needs. In the first section of this chapter, we have presented the four generic strategies that a MNC can follow to gain a competitive advantage in worldwide markets: the international, multinational, global and transnational strategies. We have also explain that firms are, to a significant extent, captives of their administrative and cultural heritage and that, due to this heritage, typical American MNCs have tended to follow an international strategy, typical European MNCs have tended to follow a multinational strategy, and typical Japanese MNCs have tended to adopt a global strategy. Finally, we have shown that more recently, due to a conve rgence phenomenon, MNCs from all regions are now adopting a transnational strategy. In the next section, we present how these four generic strategies at corporate-level influence marketing strategic decision-making. DECISION-MAKING ABOUT MARKETING ACTIVITIES Within the general framework introduc ed in the first section of this chapter, decision-making about marketing activities in a MNC has two important dimensions: (1) decision-making configuration, which refers to the location of various marketing decision centers through the world (geographically centralized or decentralized); and (2) decision-making coordination ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='16. and integration, which refers to the extent of standardization or adaptation of marketing decisions internationally. When centralized decision-making is in place, most important decision are made at the top; if decentralized decision making is in place, decision are delegated to operating personne l. Another issue is how decision-making is used to help the subsidiary respond to the econom ic and political demands of the country. Sometimes, these decisions are heavily econom ic in orientation and may concentrate on things such as return on investment for overseas operations. Other times, decisions are a result of cultural differences. For example, the performance evaluation decisions of local personne l by expatriate managers are greatly affected by the expatriate’s cultural values (cf. Hofstede, 1980b,  1991,  2001) . The best way to illustrate differences in decision-making styles in the international arena is to give some comparative examples (cf. box 5).  Box 5: The Impact of Culture on Decision-Making Processes Given the differences in value orientations, Hofstede has long questioned whether American theories could be applied abroad and discussed the consequences of cultural differences in terms organization and decision-making processes (Hofstede, 1980a). He argued, for example, that firms in countries with high power distance would tend to have more levels of hierarchy (vertical differentiation), a higher proportion of supervisory personnel (narrow span of control), and more centralized decision-making. In countries with high uncertainty avoidance, firms would tend to have more formalization evident in a greater amount of written rules and procedures. Also there would be greater specialization evident in the importance attached to technical competence in the role of staff and in defining jobs and functions. In countries with a high collectivist orientation, there would be a preference for group as opposed to individual decision-making. Consensus and cooperation would be more valued than individual initiative and effort. In countries ranked high on masculinity, the management style is likely to be more concerned with task accomplishment than nurturing social relationships. Two particularly important cultural dimensions are power distance and uncertainty avoidance: power distance is involved in answering the question of who decides what (headquarters or subsidiaries), and uncertainty avoidance is involved in answering the question how one (the headquarters) can assure that what should be done will be done (Hofstede, 1980a, 2001; Pugh and Hickson, 1976). Latin countries that are high both on power distance and uncertainty avoidance are more mechanistic (Burns and Stalker, 1961) (i.e., bureaucratic). Nordic countries, and to a lesser extent, the Anglo countries, that rank low both on power distance and uncertainty avoidance are more organic (Burns and Stalker, 1961) (i.e., less hierarchic, more decentralized, having less formalized rules and procedures). In Germanic societies where power distance is low but uncertainty avoidance is high, organizations where hierarchy is downplayed, decisions are decentralized, but where rules and regulations are more formal, and task roles and responsibilities are more clearly defined. Thus there is no need for a boss, as the organization runs by routines. In Asian organizations where power distance is high but uncertainty avoidance is low, organizations resemble families or tribes. Here, headquarters are the boss, and the relationship between headquarter and subsidiaries may be described as paternalistic. Subsidiaries do not have clearly defined task roles and responsibilities (formalization), but instead social roles.  Douglas and Craig (1989)  emphasized the importance of coordination and integration issues by relating changes in marketing strategic decisions to the evolution of a firm’s worldwide ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

They identified three main phases in the evolution of worldwide marketing strategy with each stage presenting new strategic challenges and decision priorities to the firm. • Phase one: Phase one represents the initial stage of international market expansion where the main strategic decisions facing the business include the choice of country to enter, the mode of entry adopted and the extent of produc t standardization or adaptation. • Phase two: Once the company has established a ‘beachhead’ in a number of foreign markets, it then begins to seek new directions for growth and expansion, thus moving to phase two of internationalization. The focus in this stage is mainly on building market penetration in countries where the company is already located. In consequence, the expansion effort is mainly directed by local management with marketing strategy being determined on a country-by-country or nationally respons ive basis. • Phase three: It is the third evolutionary phase which is the most important in the context of global marketing. In phase three the business moves towards a global orientation. The country-by-country approach to marketing is replaced by one in which markets are viewed as a set of interrelated and interdependent entities. These are increasingly integrated and interlinked worldwide and coordination and integration of global marketing becomes essential to fully exploit the competitive advantages to be derived from the company’s global scope. According to Douglas and Craig (1989)  there are two key strategic thrusts in phase three.  First, the drive to improve the efficiency of worldwide operations through coordination and integration. This will cover both marketing activities such as produc t development, advertising, distribution and pricing; but also related produc tion, sourcing and management. Standardization of produc t lines globally, for example, will facilitate the development of a globally integrated produc tion and logistics network.  The second key strategic thrust is the search for global expansion and growth oppor tunities. This will involve a range of activities including oppor tunities for transferring produc ts, brand names, marketing ideas, skills and expertise between countries; the identification of global market segments and target customers; and worldwide produc t development aimed at global markets. After having presented and shown the importance of the two dimensions of decision-making that are configuration and coordination, we need to explain, now, how these dimensions are ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

International Decision-Making First, we present decision-making in MNCs having adopted an international strategy. As we have mentioned earlier, an international strategy is primarily based on transferring and adapting the parent firm’s know ledge or capabilities to foreign markets. In firms following this strategy, the parent retains considerable influence and control over decisions related to its core competencies and the foreign subsidiaries have respons ibility over the decisions on how to leverage these competencies by adapting products and other marketing activities to the needs and preferences of their local markets (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . Carrefour, the French retailer, for example, uses a standardized hypermarket format, it adapt from country to country (cf. box 6).  Box 6: Carrefour’s Internationalization Carrefour has become the first retailer in Europe, second largest worldwide, leader in nine countries and has more than 9200 stores in 30 countries. More than 50 percent of its revenues came from its international stores. Carrefour international strategy is based on the hypermarket format with local adaptability. For example, while the store format is the same anywhere around the world, the company sells hot meals to French customers in France, Pasta in Argentina and Italy, and it has sushi bars in most Asian countries. The success of Carrefour export of its hypermarket concept is due, at least in part, to its careful choice of countries and the ability to adapt its format to local business environments. The internationalization concept of Carrefour is based on: (1) A simple and clear idea – people in major cities prefer to do all their shopping under one roof. Carrefour’s logic is based on the belief that choice, self-service, free parking and low prices have universal appeal. Although these principles might seem simple, the introduction of free parking in South Korea and Singapore was considered revolutionary given the high cost of land in these countries; (2) Evolving ideas – each hypermarket around the world should keep reinventing itself to meet the demands of local customers. For instance, the company has recently introduced organic food in France, optical shops and tire installation in Taiwan and gas stations in Argentina. Different formats are present in different countries; while the hypermarket model is the only format in emerging economies in South America and Asia; different formats exist in European countries. In addition, in contrast to its standard entry mode by ownership, Carrefour entered several countries – the United Arab Emirates, Madagascar, Qatar, Romania, Santo Domingo, Tunisia through a franchise partnership.

To better sense and exploit local oppo rtunities, decision-making is decentralized. Furthermore, decisions related to the foreign operations tend to be made in an oppor tunistic or ad hoc manner (cf. box 7).   Box 7: Heineken’s First Foreign Markets The internationalization history of Heineken, the Dutch brewer, provides a classic example of choices made on the basis of stand-alone attractiveness. Heineken’s first foreign markets were Egypt, Ceylon, Singapore, Indonesia, the West Indies, and the Congo. What did these six countries have in common? Heineken chose the first five countries because they were either former Dutch colonies or on shipping routes to them. These factors made those markets very attractive to Heineken, even though each country had little effect on Heineken’s global position. The last country on the list, the Congo, came about because a Belgian brewer, which also had business in the Congo, had been sold to a Belgian bank, which then asked Heineken to take care of the company.

Global Decision-Making A global strategy requires considerably more central coordination and control than the international or the multinational strategies. In MNCs following such a global strategy, research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities are typically managed from the headqua rters, and most strategic decisions are also taken at the center. The role of the subsidiaries is mainly to implement headqua rters’ decisions. In such firms, decision about the internationalization process is highly integrated, market are selected and entered according to a well-crafted global plan (cf. box 8).  Box 8: Japanese Firms’ Expansion Path Japanese firms often use a global strategic approach to market selection. Kotler, Fahey and Jatusripitak (1985) identified three typical path of expansion used by Japanese firms, each with a clear global plan. The most common was to move from Japan to developing countries to developed countries. This occurred in steel, automobiles, petrochemicals, consumer electronics, home appliances, watches, and cameras. In this path the Japanese companies built up experience and capacity in the smaller and easier developing countries. Typically, the United States was then the first developed country to be penetrated, because of its large size; its relative closeness to Japan; and the lower level of tariff, cultural, and language barriers than in Europe. The second expansion path, going straight to developed countries, particularly the U. S., occurred in high-technology industries such as computers and semiconductors. In this expansion mode the Japanese also sometimes used countries similar to the United States as trial markets. Fujitsu used Australia this way in computers. A third expansion path was to start directly with developed countries. This happened with products for which the Japanese home market was still not developed or too small (for example, videotape recorders, color televisions, and sewing machines).

Transnational Decision-Making In firms following a transnational strategy, decisions that need corporate management supervision or protection from corporate espionage are usually concentrated at the home country corporate headqua rters. These include decisions such as on basic research unde rpinning the firm’s core competencies, treasury function and international management development respons ibility. Some other strategic decisions are concentrated in different subsidiaries in a configuration described by Ghoshal and Bartlett (1998)  as excentralization rather than decentralization. Excentralisation requires the distribution and specialization of decision-making in such a way that the MNC is able to exploit the comparative advantages of the different countries where it has operations and at the same time attain scale efficiency in these operations (Dunning, 1992;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . An MNC, advertising and Marketing decisions may be centralized in London,  when decisions about produc tion coordination are concentrated in South West Asian, and when decisions concerning new produc t development are made in Silicon Valley. Other decisions, such as advertising campaigns and media planning, are distributed in individual subsidiaries because the benefits of flexible local respons iveness exceed those of econom ies of scale. The loss of coordination arising from this distribution of decisions is compensated by its potentials for respons iveness to specific national needs and political interests, flexibility, labor disputes, natural calamities and other localized disruptions, and reduction of coordination costs. The result is a complex configuration of assets, resources, and capabilities that centralizes some decisions at home, excentralizes some abroad, and distributes yet others among the MNC’s many national operations.  Nestlé’s Brand Strategy It is evident that the decision to brand globally or locally is not simple. Many MNCs therefore adopt a hierarchy of global, regional and local brands (Kotabe and Helsen, 2004) to combine the benefits of global and local branding. The Swiss company Nestlé has, for example: 10 global corporate brands including Nestlé, Carnation, Perrier; 45 global strategic brands including Kit Kat, Polo, Smarties, After Eight; 140 regional strategic brands including Macintosh, Vittel, Contadina; and 7500 local brands including Texicana, Rocky, etc.  ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

Conclusion In this section, we have shown the influence of culture on MNCs decision-making and presented the four generic decision-making processes used by MNCs having adopted an international, multinational, global or transnational strategy. We have also provided examples of marketing decision-making from MNCs following these different strategies. In the next sections, we present how these four generic decision-making strategies are implemented in two important marketing decisions: innova tion and new produc t development and service quality strategies. INNOVATION AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT The development and launch of new produc ts or services is one of the most important marketing decisions. In competitive worldwide markets, to sustain growth and maintain profitability over the longe r term, MNCs must develop a steady stream of new produc ts or services (Kotler, 2000) . Innova tion and new product development are particularly important because of the rapid changes in customer tastes, technology and competition. Traditionally, MNCs’ innova tive capabilities were dominated by one of two classic processes: center-for-global and local-for-local (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . In a center-for-global innova tion model, the new oppor tunity or risk that triggered an innova tion was usually sensed in the home country, the centralized resources and capabilities of the parent company were brought  to create the new produc t or process, and implementation involved driving the innova tion through subsidiaries whose role was to introduc e it to their local market. In contrast, local-for-local innova tion relies on subsidiary-based know ledge development. Respondi ng to perceived local oppor tunities, these local entities use their own resources and capabilities to create innov ative respons es that are then implemented in the local market. While most MNCs have tried to develop elements of both models of innova tion, the tension that exists between the knowledge management processes suppor ting each usually means that one dominates (cf. box 9). Not surprisingly, the center-for-global innova tion tends to dominate in firms following a global strategy, and the local-for-local innova tion in firms following a multinational strategic model.  Box 9: Comparing U.S. and Japanese R&D Strategies On national comparisons, Johnson (1984) compared the R&D strategies of Japanese and U.S. companies to determine whether differences in these had contributed to different competitive positions. He noted ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='22. that Japanese businesses: (1) invested more heavily in applied research and product development (and less in basic research projects); (2) invested more on building on preexisting products and technologies developed by other companies in the same or related industries, rather than in the development of new, unproven products or technologies; and (3) tended to follow the products or technologies of other businesses, rather than trying to be first. This pattern of difference is by now well established, of course, and Johnson (1984) showed that over the period 1965-1981, Japanese companies pursuing such strategies had a substantially higher private rate of return than their U.S. counterparts. In seeking explanations for this, he emphasized the importance of differential government subsidiaries and tax incentives for R&D in the two countries. He also indicated that the U.S. government’s strict enforcement of the patent system has deterred many U.S. companies from taking advantage of opportunities to build on the products and technologies of their foreign competitors.  In recent years, these traditional innova tion processes have been evolving into new ways of developing and diffusing know ledge and innovative ideas. These new transnational innova tion processes fall into two broad categories that Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998)  describe as locally leveraged and globally linked. The former involves ensuring that the special resources and capabilities of each national subsidiary are available not only to that local entity, but also to other MNC subsidiaries worldwide. The latter process of innovation pools the resources and capabilities of many different units-at both the parent company and subsidiary level-to jointly create and manage an activity. Both processes are associated with a transnational strategy. International New Product Development Firms following an international strategy do not have an international new produc t development strategy per se, but following Vernon (1966) ’s international produc t cycle theory (cf. box 2), they first develop new products for their domestic market, and only subsequently sold these produc ts abroad, usually with minimal adaptations. The process is primarily based on transferring and adapting the parent company’s produc ts characteristics to the foreign markets preferences. (cf. box 10)  Box 10: Xerox and Fuji Xerox Fuji Xerox, the 50/50 joint venture established by Fuji Photo Film and Rank in 1962, was originally intended to be a marketing organization to sell xerographic products manufactured by Fuji Photo Film. When the Japanese government refused to approve a joint venture intended solely as a sales companies, however, the agreement was revised to give Fuji Xerox manufacturing rights. Fuji Xerox, not Fuji Photo Film, then became the contracting party with Rank Xerox, and received exclusive right to xerographic patents in Japan. As part of its technology licensing agreements with Rank Xerox, Fuji Xerox had exclusive rights to sell the machines in Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indochina. In return, Fuji Xerox would pay Rank Xerox a royalty of 5% on revenues from the sale of ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='23. xerographic products. Rank Xerox would also be entitled to 50% of Fuji Xerox’s profits. A board of directors consisting of representatives from Rank Xerox and Fuji Photo Film was established to decide policy matters, while day-to-day operations were left to the Japanese management. Although Fuji Xerox adopted a number of business practices from Xerox, including organizational structure and the rental system, it remained distinctly Japanese throughout its history. At the establishment of the joint venture, a specific schedule was agreed upon, calling first for the sale of imported machines, then the assembly of imported knocked-down kits, and finally the domestic production of copiers. In 1971, Fuji Photo Film transferred its copier plants to Fuji Xerox. The same year, Fuji Xerox competed the construction of a 160’000 square-foot manufacturing and engineering facility. The transfer of production facilities to Fuji Xerox and the direct relationship established between Fuji Xerox and Xerox contributed to a continued strengthening of Fuji Xerox technical capabilities. Fuji Photo Film engineers had already been making modifications to Xerox designs in order to adapt the copiers to the local market; Japanese offices, for example, used different sized paper than American Offices. Fuji Xerox’s CEO, however, advocated the development of long-term R&D capabilities that would enable the company to develop its own products. In particular, he envisioned a high-performance, inexpensive, compact machine that could copy books. At the time, Xerox’s priorities were different. In addition to developing small machines for its local market, Fuji Xerox tried to stem the competitive onslaught with more aggressive strategies. The company began to offer two- and three-year rental contract as well as its standard one-year contract, and provided price incentives that were tied to contract length. During the 1970s, competition in the U.S. and European copier markets changed radically. Prior to that period, Xerox had had a virtual monopoly because of its xerography patents. But beginning in 1970, one competitor after another entered the industry, often with new and improved technologies. About 1978, Fuji Xerox offered to sell its small copiers to Xerox and Rank Xerox to help them counter Japanese competition in the U.S. and Europe. In 1979, largely because of Rank Xerox’s success with Fuji Xerox products, Xerox began to import Fuji Xerox products too. Typically, in the year that the products were introduced in the U.S. Market, the machines were assembled by Fuji Xerox before export. Then, acceding to union demand in the U.S., Fuji Xerox exported them as knock-down units to be assembled at Xerox. Fuji Xerox developed its technological capabilities further in the 1980s, investing heavily in R&D. While it continued to rely on Xerox for basic research on new technologies, by the late 1980s very few of the models sold by Fuji Xerox in Japan had been designed by Xerox (Source: adapted from McQuade and Gomes-Casseres, 1992)  Global New Product Development The key strength on which many Japanese firms built their global leadership positions during the 1970s  and 80s in a diverse range of businesses, from zippers to automobiles, lies in the effectiveness of their center-for-global innovations (Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) . This is not to say that they do not use some of the other operative modes, but in general, the Japanese are today’s champion managers of centralized activities and tasks (Yip, 2003) . In a center-for-global innova tion model, the new oppor tunity or risk that triggered an innova tion is usually sensed in the firm’s home country, the centralized R&D department of the firms are brought  to create the new produc t, and implementation involved driving the innova tion through  subsidiaries whose role is to introduc e it to their local market. Three factors stand out as the most important explanations of Japanese MNCs outstanding success in managing the center-for-global process: (1) gaining the input of subsidiaries into centralized activities, (2) ensuring that all functional tasks are linked to market needs, and (3) integrating value chain functions such as development, produc tion, and marketing by ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='24. managing the transfer of respons ibilities among them. For example, at Matsushita, the integrative systems rely heavily on the transfer of people. First, the career paths of research engineers are structured so as to ensure that a majority of them spend about five to eight years in the central research laboratories engaged in pure research, then another five years in the produc t divisions in applied research and development, and finally in a direct operational function, such as produc tion or marketing, wherein they take line-management positions for the rest of their working lives. More important, each engineer usually makes the transition from one department to the next along with the transfer of the major project on which he has been working (Bartlett, 2002 ). Multinational New Product Development European MNCs rather prefer to develop local-for-local innova tion processes, which rely on subsidiary-based know ledge development. For reasons related to their unique administrative and cultural heritage, European companies have a track record of local adaptation and functional excellence unmatched by other companies of comparable size, diversity, and maturity, to the extent that many European MNCs are often thought  to be a domestic company in the countries in which they operate. Respondi ng to perceived local oppor tunities, these local entities use their own resources and capabilities to create innov ative responses that are then implemented in the local market. Of the many factors that facilitate local-for-local innova tions, there are three that are the most significant: (1) the ability to empower local management in the different national organizations; (2) to establish effective mechanisms for linking the local managers to corporate decision-making processes; and (3) to force tight cross-functional integration within each subsidiary (cf. box 11).  Box 11: Philips’s Multinational Innovation Since it was founded in 1891, Philips has recognized the need to expand its operations beyond its small domestic market, but the successive barriers-poor transport and communication linkages in the early decades of the century, protectionist pressures in the 1930s, and the disruption of World War II—encouraged the company to build national organizations with a substantial degree of autonomy and self-sufficiency. Such dispersed managerial and technological resources, coupled with local autonomy and decentralized control over the resources, enable subsidiary managers to be more effective in managing local development, manufacturing, and other functional tasks, such as marketing (Source: adapted from Bartlett, 2002).

       " Document(page_content='25. Transnational New Product Development The complexity of the innova tion and new product development processes in a MNC is significantly enhanced by the fact that the location of an oppor tunity is often different from the location where the complementary capability of the company is located. For example, while a company’s hardware technology and main research laboratories may be in Japan, and its most-skilled software engineers may be in the United States, its fastest growth market oppor tunities may be in Europe (Johns on, 1995;  Roth and Morrison, 1990) . To tackle this challenge, firms following a transnational strategy have developed a two-pronge d approach described by Bartlett and Ghoshal (Bartlett, Ghoshal and Birkinshaw, 2004;  Ghoshal and Bartlett, 1998) , as locally leveraged and globally linked. The locally leveraged and globally linked processes use linkages among different units of the firm to leverage existing resources and capabilities, regardless of their locations, to exploit oppor tunities that arise in any part of the firm’s worldwide operations. This involves building an integrated network configuration featuring a combination of centralized, specialized and distributed assets and capabilities, to ensure that know ledge developed in headqua rters or subsidiary units become available throughout  the firm and that the special capabilities available in different units are pooled to tackle tasks in any part of the firm’s worldwide operations. The two aspects of this approach ensure high levels of know ledge creation, diffusion, and worldwide learning within the MNC. The first aspect of the approach is centralized know ledge development and diffusion. In this case, know ledge is developed in the centralized operations but also incorporating inputs from different subsidiaries to ensure that the centralized know ledge development process is market driven. The developed know ledge is diffused through transfer of personne l involved in the process to other units thereby broadening the scope for know ledge sharing. The second aspect of the approach is localized know ledge development in which empowered subsidiaries develop special know ledge based on creative responses to local environmental demands made possible by tight cross-functional integration. Conclusion While the two more sophisticated processes that result in transnational innova tions are becoming more widespread, they have supplemented rather than replaced the traditional central and local innova tion processes. In a competitive environment, most companies recognize the need to engage their resources and capabilities in as many ways as they can. In other words, they must maximize the number of processes through which they can develop ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='26. new know ledge, build new capabilities, and deploy new ideas rapidly around the globe. The challenge is to build an organization that can simultaneously facilitate all four processes of innova tion and learning. SERVICE QUALITY STRATEGIES Beside innova tion and new produc t development, another important strategic decision for MNCs is the one related to the quality of its products and services. Because, this decision is more complicated and more important in the case of services compared to the case of produc t (Zeithaml, Berry and Parasuraman, 1985,  1988 ), we will focus our attention, in the chapter, on service quality strategies. In services marketing, the concept of service quality plays a central role in unde rstanding customer satisfaction and retention (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry 1985) . Typical services differ from phys ical produc ts in four key ways: (1) they are intangible as they cannot be stored or readily displayed or communicated; (2) produc tion and consumption of services are inseparable; (3) services cannot be inventoried, and produc tion lines do not exist to deliver standardized products of consistent quality, therefore, delivered services are heterogeneous in nature; finally (4), because services cannot be stored, they assume a perishable nature (e.g., Zeithaml, Parasuraman and Berry, 1985;  Zeithaml and Bitner, 2003 )3. These characteristics have a strong impact on the internationalization strategies of service firms as well as on the standardization or segmentation of service quality (Furrer, Liu, and Sudha rshan, 2000;  Lovelock and Yip, 1996;  Vandermerwe and Chadwick, 1989) . There are fewer oppor tunities to realize econom ies of scale with services than with phys ical produc ts and guaranteeing service quality worldwide is more difficult (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey, 2004) . However, not every service is equally affected by these characteristics. Lovelock and Yip (1996)  distinguish between three categories of services: (1) people-processing services, that involve tangible actions to customers in person; (2) possession-processing services, that involve tangible actions to phys ical objects; and (3) information-based services, that depend on collecting, manipulating, interpreting, and transmitting data to create value. People-processing services necessarily involve a high degree of contact with service personne l and                                                 3 Another important characteristic is the absence of ownership (Judd, 1964; Lovelock and Gummesson, 2004; Rathmell, 1966, 1974). This characteristic is, however, less relevant in the internationalization context we are discussing in this chapter. ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='27. facilities (Lovelock and Yip 1996) ; therefore, there is a need for segmentation to adapt these services to local cultures (Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan, 2000) . On the contrary, possession-processing and information-based services have the potential to be much lower contact in nature (Lovelock and Yip 1996) , so they can be standardized at the global level. That is, it is when services involve a high degree of interaction between customers and service personnel, that cultural elements have the greatest influence (Furrer, Liu and Sudharshan, 2000) . Culture affects a number of aspects of the service experience, including customer expectations, the waiting experience, and the recruitment and behavior of service personne l (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey, 2004)  (cf. box 12). One element of service marketing that is particularly influenced by culture is service quality (Donthu and Yoo, 1998;  Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan, 2000;  Mattila, 1999;  Winsted, 1997 )  Box 12: Influence of Culture on the Service Experience Customer Expectations: Customers may exhibit different expectations concerning service levels. Department stores in Japan still employ women in kimonos to bow and greet customers as they arrive at the store. Service personnel are available and solicitous. In the U.S., consumers tend to be willing to forgo high levels of service in favor of low prices. They are more accustomed to self-service and may even feel nervous in the presence of hovering salespeople (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey, 2004). The Waiting Experience: Time is always an aspect of services, and attitudes toward the time it takes to be served vary across cultures (Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner, 1998). For example, waiters in European restaurants take care not to hurry patrons. Eating a meal is supposed to be an enjoyable experience most often shared with friends. Servers also wait to be asked to deliver the bill for the meal. Diners may wish to sit for hours. Americans would wonder what had happened to their waiter. Americans expect fast service at restaurants and like the bill to be dropped promptly on the table. What would be a good service experience for a European diner would be a bad one for an American (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey, 2004). Service Personnel: In many cultures, such as the Middle East, working in a service occupation is often considered akin to being a servant. This social stigma can make it hard to recruit qualified personnel for some positions, especially those that require higher levels of education as well as technical and interpersonal skills. Until relatively recently, stewardesses for many airlines from the Middle East had to be imported from Europe, and nursing has never achieved the status in the Middle East as in the West. Men as well as women feel the stigma. It is not uncommon for well-paid technical repairmen, such as those in work in air conditioning, to dress in a suit and tie and carry their tools in a briefcase (Gillespie, Jeannet and Hennessey, 2004).  Service quality is one of the most important issues for service firms (Fisk, Brown and Bitner, 1993) . Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1985,  1988;  Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman 1988)  identified five dimensions of service quality (SERVQUAL): Reliability, Respons iveness, Assurance, Tangibles, and Empathy that have been widely used by service firms. Of these five dimensions, reliability is the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately. Respons iveness is the willingne ss to help customers and provide ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='28. prompt service. Assurance is the know ledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to conve y trust and confidence. Empathy is the caring individualized attention provided to the customer, and tangibles are the appearance of phys ical facilities, equipment, personne l, and communication materials. However, the development of these service quality dimensions was based on research conduc ted across multiple contexts only within the U.S. (Zeithaml and Bitner, 2003)  As a general rule, reliability comes through as the most important dimension of service quality in the U.S., with respons iveness also being relatively important when compared to the remaining three dimensions. But what happens when we look across culture? Are the service quality dimensions still important? Which ones are most important? (Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan, 2000) . Recent studies by Winsted (1997) , Donthu and Yoo (1998) , Mattila (1999)  and Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan (2000)  have established a strong link between cultural dimensions and service quality. For example, Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan (2000)  used Hofstede’s (1980b,  1991,  2001)  cultural dimensions to assess whether service quality importance would vary across different cultural orientations. They found,  in cultures with a large power distance, significant negative relationships between power distance and empathy, respons iveness, and reliability. In such cultures with a large power distance, customers are more likely to tolerate failure when service providers are perceived as experts. In cultures with a high degree of individualism, customers are more independent and self-centered. Individualists, due to their drive and self-respons ibility ethic, demand that others be efficient and therefore demand a high level of service quality. During their relationships with a service provider, individualists also prefer to maintain a distance between themselves and the service provider. Due to their self-confidence and self-respons ibility, Individualists do not expect to be assured by service providers. In cultures with a high degree of masculinity, customers expect a female service provider to be more feminine than professional. This is suppor ted by the significant negative relationships between masculinity and respons iveness. In cultures with a high degree of masculinity, it is important for female service employees to have feminine appearance, which is suppor ted by a significant positive relationship between masculinity and tangibles. In frequent service situations, uncertainty from the possibility of failure has to be reduced by the guarantee of a quick solution to problems. This hypot hesis is suppor ted by the significant positive relationships between uncertainty avoidance and respons iveness, assurance, empathy, and reliability. On the other hand, in frequent service situations, tangibles are less important ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='29. because they do not help reducing perceived risk of service failure. In cultures with a long-term orientation, long-term relationships with service providers are expected. In these cultures, reliability, respons iveness, and empathy are extremely important. Also significant are the negative relationships between long-term orientation and assurance and between long-term orientation and tangibles are also significant (cf. box 13). Furthermore, a study by Liu, Furrer and Sudha rshan (2001)  also showed that service customers from different cultures react differently when faced with poor quality services, if customers from cultures with lower individualism or higher uncertainty avoidance tend to complain less, customers from cultures with higher individualism or lower uncertainty avoidance tend to switch provider, engage in negative word of mouth, and complain.  Box 13: Cross-Cultural Preferences in Luxury Hotels In the context of luxury hotels, customer with a Western cultural background (individualism, small power distance) rely more on the tangible cues from the physical environment and their Asian counterparts (collectivism, large power distance) are more likely to rely on deportment of service personnel staff. The hedonic dimension of consumption experience is also more important for Western consumers than for Asian ones (Source: Adapted from Mattila, 1999).  This relationship between culture and customers’ perceptions of quality being stronge r for service experiences than for the purchase of a tangible produc t, MNCs in service indus tries had to adapt their worldwide marketing strategies. Most service firms having started their internationalization later than most produc t firms, they learned from the experience of these firms (Vandermerwe and Chadwick, 1986) . Recognizing that an international or a global strategy would be difficult due to the intangible nature of most services and the various cultures of their world customers and recognizing that a multinational strategy would be to costly to implement and to manage due to the large number of differences within and across cultures, they often adopted a transnational strategy as soon as they started their internationalization process. Service firms following such a transnational strategy have two leviers to achieve both global efficiency and local respons iveness by coordinating service quality across countries and cultures: (1) cross-cultural segmentation and (2) the standardization of the core service and the adaptation of supplementary services. The traditional approach to worldwide marketing segmentation was to segment a market on a country basis to take account of national differences in demand conditions. Kale and Sudha rshan (1987) , however, sugge sted a different approach for segmenting worldwide markets, which is more compatible with the requirement for transnational marketing strategy. ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='30. The approach makes customers and their needs the basis for segmentation. It has the advantage of being consumer orientated, while allowing worldwide coordination of marketing, since it focuses on similarities rather than differences across groups  of consumers in different countries or cultures. The basis of this approach is the identification of transnational segments of consumers, with similar needs, who will respond similarly to a given marketing mix. Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan (2000)  identified five different customer segments based on differences in the importance of service quality and cultural dimensions (cf. box 13).  Box 13: Five Transnational Service Customer Segments Followers: Large power distance, high collectivism, high masculinity, neutral uncertainty avoidance, arid short-term orientation. Balance seekers: Small power distance, high collectivism, neutral masculinity, high uncertainty avoidance, and medium-term orientation. Self-confidents: Small power distance, high individualism, medium femininity, low uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. Sensory seekers: Large power distance, medium individualism, high masculinity, low uncertainty avoidance, and short-term orientation. Functional analyzers: Small power distance, medium individualism, high femininity, high uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation.  Figure 2 graphically presents the relative importance given by each of these five segments to the different dimensions of service quality. From figure 2 it is clear that the service quality dimensions are important across cultures, but their relative importance varies depending on cultural value orientation. For example, small power distance cultures with high to medium individualism and long-term orientation (self-confidents and functional analyzers) rate reliability and respons iveness as most important. On the other hand, cultures with large power distance and high masculinity (followers and sensory seekers) rate these same dimensions as less important. The tangibles dimension shows the widest variation, with sensory seekers rating it most important and functional analyzers rating it least important.

Furrer, Liu and Sudha rshan (2000)  also sugge st a number of implications for companies serving multiple cultures. For example, if the target market has a follower cultural profile, service providers may want to emphasize training their employees to have professional know ledge and be trustworthy to gain the trust of these customers, combined with tangibles and empathy to conve y service quality. On the other hand, to serve self-confidents, providers should emphasize equipping and empowering the employees so they are capable of providing reliable, respons ive service. A second element of a transnational strategy for service firms, propos ed by Lovelock and Yip (1996) , is the standardization of the core service and the cultural adaptation of the supplementary services. Most services comprise a core service (e.g., a bed for the night, restoring a defective computer to good working order, or a bank account) and a variety of supplementary or suppor ting services (Furrer, 1997,  1998,  1999;  Lovelock, 1994;  Lovelock and Yip, 1996). In the core service may benefit to be standardized, increasingly, the supplementary elements not only add value, but also provide the needed local adaptation. There are potentially dozens of different supplementary services, although they can be groupe d into eight categories: information, consultation, order-taking, hospitality, care-taking, exceptions, billing, and payment (Lovelock, 1994)  (cf. box 14). Many of these services are based on informational processes that can be located in one part of the world and delivered electronically to another. Those may benefit to be standardized, other are involve a personal interaction between the customer and the service provider and should be customized. In developing a transnational strategy, service firms must decide which supplementary elements ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='32. should be consistent and have the same level of quality across all markets and which might be tailored to meet local needs and expectations. This is the essence of the transnational strategy, but services offer much more flexibility in this respect than do tangible goods  (Lovelock and Yip, 1996) .  Box 14: Eight Categories of Supplementary Services Information: To obtain full value from any service, customers need relevant information about it, ranging from schedules to operating instructions, and from user warnings to price. Internationalization affects the nature of that information (including the languages and format in which it is provided). Consultation: Consultation and advice involve a dialogue to probe customer requirements and then develop a tailored solution. Customers’ need for advice may vary widely based of their culture. Order-Taking: Once the customers are ready to buy, suppliers need to make it easy for them to place orders or reservations in the language of their choice, through telecommunications and other channels. Hospitality: Well-managed businesses try to treat customers as guests when they have to visit the supplier’s facility. Cultural definitions of appropriate hospitality may differ widely from one culture to another, such as the tolerable length of waiting time. Care-Giving: When visiting a service site, customers often want assistance with their personal possessions, ranging from car parking to packaging and delivery of new purchase. Expectation may vary by culture. Exceptions: Exceptions fall outside the routine of normal service delivery. They include special requests, problem solving, handling of complaints/suggestions/compliments, and restitution. Billing: Customers need clear, timely bills that explain how charges are computed. Bills could be converted in the customer’s home currency. Payment: Ease and convenience of payment (including credit) are increasingly expected by customers when purchasing a broad array of services. Major credit cards solve the problem of paying in foreign funds for many retail purchasers. (Source: Adapted from Lovelock, 1994 and Lovelock and Yip, 1996  CONCLUSION In this chapter, we have presented worldwide marketing strategies as framed by the response to or management of two imperatives: meeting local demands and capitalizing on worldwide competitive advantages. Within this framework, we have identified four generic worldwide strategies: the international, multinational, global, and transnational strategy. We have also shown that these four strategies could be distinguished by their different positioning on three key-dimensions that are: standardization-adaptation, configuration-coordination, and strategic integration. We have also shown that, constrained by their administrative and cultural heritage, MNCs from different regions of the world tend to follow a particular generic strategy: Typical American MNCs tend to follow an international strategy, typical European ', metadata={'source': 'files\\\\MarketingStrategies.pdf', 'page': 31})]"

Offering loyalty programs, limited edition collections, or personalized recommendations can attract repeat customers.\\n\\n4. **Geographic Segmentation**: Watches can be marketed differently based on the location and cultural preferences of customers. For example, watches with specific features or designs may be more popular in certain regions or countries.\\n\\nBy effectively segmenting the market and understanding the unique needs and preferences of different customer groups, watch companies can create targeted marketing campaigns, design products that appeal to specific segments, and provide personalized shopping experiences. This approach can lead to increased customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and ultimately, higher sales.\"}"
